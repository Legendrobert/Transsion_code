that it can ascribe to him any one motive or group of motives
it is apparent however that oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment
he does not appear to have been able to establish meaningful relationships with other people he was perpetually discontented with the world around him
long before the assassination he expressed his hatred for american society and acted in protest against it
oswald's search for what he conceived to be the perfect society was doomed from the start
he sought for himself a place in history a role as the great man who would be recognized as having been in advance of his times
his commitment to marxism and communism appears to have been another important factor in his motivation
he also had demonstrated a capacity to act decisively and without regard to the consequences when such action would further his aims of the moment
out of these and the many other factors which may have molded the character of lee harvey oswald
there emerged a man capable of assassinating president kennedy
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warren commission report by
the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy chapter eight the protection of the president part one
in the one hundred years since eighteen sixty five
four presidents of the united states have been assassinated
abraham lincoln james a garfield william mckinley and john f kennedy
during this same period there were three other attacks on the life of a president
a president elect and a candidate for the presidency which narrowly failed
on theodore roosevelt while campaigning in october of nineteen twelve on president elect franklin delano roosevelt
when visiting miami on february fifteen nineteen thirty three and on president harry s truman on november one nineteen fifty
when his temporary residence blair house was attacked by puerto rican nationalists
one out of every five presidents since eighteen sixty five has been assassinated
there have been attempts on the lives of one out of every three
prompted by these dismaying statistics the commission has inquired into the problems and methods of presidential protection in effect
at the time of president kennedy's assassination
this study has led the commission to conclude that the public interest might be served by any contribution it can make to the improvement of protective arrangements
the commission has not undertaken a comprehensive examination of all facets of this subject
rather it has devoted its time and resources to those broader aspects of presidential protection
to which the events of last november called attention
in this part of its inquiry the commission has had full access to a major study of all phases of protective activities
prepared by the secret service for the secretary of the treasury following the assassination as a result of this study
the secretary of the treasury has prepared a planning document dated august twenty seven nineteen sixty four
which recommends additional personnel and facilities to enable the secret service to expand its protection capabilities
the secretary of the treasury submitted this planning document on august thirty one nineteen sixty four
to the bureau of the budget for review and approval
this planning document has been made a part of the commission's published record the underlying staff and consultants reports reviewed by the commission have not
since a disclosure of such detailed information relating to protective measures might undermine present methods of protecting the president
however all information considered by the commission which pertains to the protective function as it was carried out in dallas has been published as part of this report
the protection of the president of the united states is an immensely difficult and complex task
it is unlikely that measures can be devised to eliminate entirely the multitude of diverse dangers that may arise
particularly when the president is traveling in this country or abroad
the protective task is further complicated by the reluctance of presidents to take security precautions which might interfere with the performance of their duties
or their desire to have frequent and easy access to the people
the adequacy of existing procedures can fairly be assessed only after full consideration of the difficulty of the protective assignment
with particular attention to the diverse roles which the president is expected to fill
after reviewing this aspect of the matter this chapter will set forth the commission's conclusions
regarding certain protective measures in force at the time of the dallas trip and propose recommendations for improvements
the nature of the protective assignment
the president is head of state chief executive commander in chief and leader of a political party
as the ceremonial head of the government the president must discharge a wide range of public duties not only in washington but throughout the land
in this role he appears to the american people in the words of william howard taft as quote
the personal embodiment and representative of their dignity and majesty end quote
as chief executive the president controls the exercise of the vast almost incalculable powers of the executive branch of the federal government
as commander in chief of the armed forces he must maintain ultimate authority over the development and disposition of our military power
in accordance with george washington's maxim that americans have a government quote of accommodation as well as a government of laws end quote
it is the president's right and duty to be the active leader of his party as when he seeks to be reelected or to maintain his party in power
in all of these roles the president must go to the people
exposure of the president to public view through travel among the people of this country is a great and historic tradition of american life
desired by both the president and the public it is an indispensable means of communication between the two
more often than not presidential journeys have served more than one purpose at the same time ceremonial
administrative political
from george washington to john f kennedy such journeys have been a normal part of the president's activities
to promote nationwide acceptance of his administration washington made grand tours that served also to excite interest in the presidency
in recent years presidential journeys have been frequent and extensive
partly because of the greater speed and comfort of travel and partly because of the greater demands made on the president
it is now possible for presidents to travel the length and breadth of a land far larger than the united states
in seventeen eighty nine in less time than it took george washington to travel from new york to mount vernon
or thomas jefferson from washington to monticello
during his presidency franklin d roosevelt made almost four hundred journeys and traveled more than three hundred fifty thousand miles
since nineteen forty five roosevelt's successors have ranged the world
and their foreign journeys have come to be accepted as normal rather than extraordinary
john f kennedy's journey to texas in november nineteen sixty three was in this tradition
his friend and special assistant kenneth o'donnell who accompanied him on his last visit to dallas
stated the president's views of his responsibilities with simplicity and clarity quote
the president's views of his responsibilities as president of the united states were that he meet the people that he go out to their homes and see them
and allow them to see him and discuss if possible the views of the world as he sees it the problems of the country as he sees them
and he felt that leaving washington for the president of the united states was a most necessary not only for the people but for the president himself
that he expose himself to the actual basic problems that were disturbing the american people
it helped him in his job here he was able to come back here with a fresh view of many things
i think he felt very strongly that the president ought to get out of washington and go meet the people on a regular basis end quote
whatever their purposes presidential journeys have greatly enlarged and complicated the task of protecting the president
the secret service and the federal state and local law enforcement agencies which cooperate with it
have been confronted in recent years with increasingly difficult problems created by the greater exposure of the president during his travels
and the greater diversity of the audiences he must face in a world torn by conflicting ideologies
if the sole goal were to protect the life of the president it could be accomplished with reasonable assurance despite the multiple roles he must play
but his very position as representative of the people prevents him from effectively shielding himself from the people
he cannot and will not take the precautions of a dictator or a sovereign
under our system measures must be sought to afford security without impeding the president's performance of his many functions
the protection of the president must be thorough but inconspicuous to avoid even the suggestion of a garrison state
the rights of private individuals must not be infringed
if the protective job is well done its performance will be evident only in the unexceptional fact of its success
the men in charge of protecting the president confronted by complex problems and limited as they are in the measures they may employ
must depend upon the utmost cooperation and understanding from the public and the president
the problem and the reasonable approach to its solution were ably stated in a memorandum prepared by fbi director j edgar hoover
for the president soon after the assassination quote
the degree of security that can be afforded the president of the united states
is dependent to a considerable extent upon the degree of contact with the general public desired by the president
absolute security is neither practical nor possible an approach to complete security would require the president
to operate in a sort of vacuum isolated from the general public and behind impregnable barriers
his travel would be in secret his public appearances would be behind bulletproof glass a more practical approach necessitates compromise
any travel any contact with the general public involves a calculated risk on the part of the president and the men responsible for his protection
such risks can be lessened when the president recognizes the security problem
has confidence in the dedicated secret service men who are ready to lay down their lives for him
and accepts the necessary security precautions which they recommend
many presidents have been understandably impatient with the security precautions which many years of experience dictate
because these precautions reduce the president's privacy and the access to him of the people of the country
nevertheless the procedures and advice should be accepted if the president wishes to have any security
evaluation of presidential protection at the time of the assassination of president kennedy
the history of presidential protection shows growing recognition over the years that the job must be done by able dedicated
thoroughly professional personnel using the best technical equipment that can be devised
the assassination of president kennedy demands an examination of the protective measures employed to safe guard him
and an inquiry whether improvements can be made which will reduce the risk of another such tragedy
this section considers first the means used to locate potential sources of danger to the president in time to take appropriate precautions
in this connection the information available to federal agencies about lee harvey oswald
is set out and the reasons why this information was not furnished to the secret service appraised
second the adequacy of other advance preparations for the security of the president during his visit to dallas
largely measures taken by the secret service is considered
finally the performance of those charged with the immediate responsibility of protecting the president on november twenty two is reviewed
intelligence functions relating to presidential protection at the time of the dallas trip
a basic element of presidential protection
is the identification and elimination of possible sources of danger to the president before the danger becomes actual
the secret service has attempted to perform this function through the activities of its protective research section
and requests to other agencies federal and local for useful information
the commission has concluded that at the time of the assassination
the arrangements relied upon by the secret service to perform this function were seriously deficient
adequacy of preventive intelligence operations of the secret service
the main job of the protective research section p r s
is to collect process and evaluate information about persons or groups who may be a danger to the president
in addition to this function p r s is responsible for such tasks
as obtaining clearance of some categories of white house employees and all tradesmen who service the white house
the security processing of gifts sent to the president and technical inspections against covert listening devices
at the time of the assassination p r s was a very small group comprised of twelve specialists and three clerks
many persons call themselves to the attention of p r s by attempting to visit the president
for bizarre reasons or by writing or in some other way attempting to communicate with him in a threatening or abusive manner
or with undue persistence
robert i bouck special agent in charge of p r s
estimated that most of the material received by his office originated in this fashion
or from the occasional investigations initiated by the secret service
while the balance was furnished to p r s by other federal agencies with primary source being the fbi
the total volume of information received by p r s has risen steadily
in nineteen forty three p r s received approximately nine thousand items of information
in nineteen fifty three this had increased to more than seventeen thousand items
in nineteen sixty three the total exceeded thirty two thousand items
since many items may pertain to a single case these figures do not show the caseload
in the period from november nineteen sixty one to november nineteen sixty three
p r s received items in eight thousand seven hundred nine cases
before the assassination of president kennedy
p r s expressed its interest in receiving information on suspects in very general terms for example
p r s instructed the white house mailroom a source of much p r s data
to refer all communications on identified existing cases and in addition
any communication quote that in any way indicates anyone may have possible intention of harming the president end quote
slightly more specific criteria were established for p r s personnel processing white house mail referred by the white house mailroom
but again the standards were very general
these instructions to p r s personnel appear to be the only instance where an effort was made to reduce the criteria to writing
when requested to provide a specific statement of the standards employed by p r s in deciding what information to seek and retain
the secret service responded quote
the criteria in effect prior to november twenty two nineteen sixty three for determining whether to accept material for the p r s general files
were broad and flexible all material is and was desired accepted and filed if it indicated or tended to indicate
that the safety of the president is or might be in danger either at the present or in the future
there are many actions situations and incidents that may indicate such potential danger some are specific such as threats
danger may be implied from others such as membership or activity in an organization which believes in assassination as a political weapon
all material received by p r s was separately screened
and a determination made as to whether the information might indicate possible harm to the president
if the material was evaluated
as indicating some potential danger to the president no matter how small it was indexed in the general p r s files
under the name of the individual or group of individuals to whom that material related end quote
the general files of p r s consist of folders on individuals card indexed by name
the files are manually maintained without use of any automatic data processing techniques
at the time of the assassination the active p r s general files contained approximately fifty thousand cases
accumulated over a twenty year period some of which included more than one individual
a case file was established if the information available suggested that the subject might be a danger to the president
many of these cases were not investigated by p r s
the case file served merely as a repository for information until enough had accumulated to warrant an investigation
during the period november nineteen sixty one to november nineteen sixty three
p r s investigated thirty four newly established or reactivated cases concerning residents of texas
most of these cases involved persons who used threatening language in communications to or about the president
an additional one hundred fifteen cases concerning texas residents were established but not investigated
when p r s learns of an individual whose conduct warrants scrutiny it requests an investigation by the closest secret service field office
of which there are sixty five throughout the country
if the field office determines that the case should be subject to continuing review p r s establishes a file
which requires a checkup at least every six months
this might involve a personal interview or interviews with members of the person's household wherever possible
the secret service arranges for the family and friends of the individual and local law enforcement officials
to advise the field office if the subject displays signs of increased danger or plans to leave his home area
at the time of the assassination there were approximately four hundred persons throughout the country who were subject to periodic review
if p r s concludes after investigation
that an individual presents a significant danger to the life of the president his name is placed in a trip index file
which is maintained on a geographical field office basis
at the time of the assassination the names of about one hundred persons were in this index all of whom were included in the group of four hundred
being reviewed regularly
p r s also maintains an album of photographs and descriptions of about twelve to fifteen individuals who are regarded as clear risks to the president
and who do not have a fixed place of residence members of the white house detail of the secret service have copies of this album
individuals who are regarded as dangerous to the president
and who are in penal or hospital custody are listed only in the general files of p r s
but there is a system for the immediate notification of the secret service by the confining institution when a subject is released or escapes
p r s attempts to eliminate serious risks by hospitalization or where necessary
the prosecution of persons who have committed an offense such as threatening the president
in june nineteen sixty four p r s had arrangements to be notified about the release or escape of approximately one thousand persons
in summary at the time of the assassination
p r s had received over a twenty year period basic information on some fifty thousand cases
it had arrangements to be notified about release from confinement in roughly one thousand cases
it had established periodic regular review of the status of four hundred individuals
it regarded approximately one hundred of these four hundred cases as serious risks
and twelve to fifteen of these cases as highly dangerous risks
members of the white house detail were expected to familiarize themselves with the descriptions and photographs of the highest risk cases
the cases subject to periodic review and the one hundred or so cases in the higher risk category
were filed on a geographic basis and could conveniently be reviewed by a secret service agent preparing for a presidential trip
to a particular part of the country these were the files reviewed by p r s on november eight nineteen sixty three
at the request of special agent lawson advance agent for president kennedy's trip to dallas
the general files of p r s were not indexed by geographic location and were of little use in preparing for a presidential visit to a specific locality
secret service requests to other agencies for intelligence information
were no more specific than the broad and general instructions its own agents and the white house mailroom
the head of p r s testified that the secret service requested other agencies to provide quote
any and all information that they may come in contact with that would indicate danger to the president end quote
these requests were communicated in writing by the secret service rather the service depended on the personal liaison maintained by p r s
with the headquarters of the federal intelligence agencies particularly the fbi
and at the working level with personnel of the field offices of the various agencies the service frequently participated
in the training programs of other law enforcement agencies and agents from other agencies attended the regular secret service training schools
presidential protection was an important topic in these training programs
in the absence of more specific instructions other federal agencies interpreted the secret service's informal requests
to relate principally to overt threats to harm the president or other specific manifestations of hostility
for example at the time of the assassination the fbi handbook which is in the possession of every bureau special agent provided quote
threats against the president of the u s
members of his immediate family the president elect and the vice president investigation of threats against the president of the united states
members of his immediate family the president elect and the vice president is within the exclusive jurisdiction of the u s secret service
any information indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president
members of the immediate family of the president the president elect or the vice president
must be referred immediately by the most expeditious means of communication to the nearest office of the u s secret service
advise the bureau at the same time by teletype of the information so furnished to the secret service and the fact that it has been so disseminated
the above action should be taken without delay in order to attempt to verify the information and no evaluation of the information should be attempted
when the threat is in the form of a written communication give a copy to local secret service and forward the original to the bureau
where it will be made available to secret service headquarters in washington
the referral of the copy to local secret service should not delay the immediate referral of the information by the fastest available means of communication
to secret service locally end quote
the state department advised the secret service of all crank and threat letter mail
or crank visitors and furnished reports concerning any assassination or attempted assassination of a ruler or other major official anywhere in the world
the several military intelligence agencies reported crank mail and similar threats involving the president
according to special agent in charge bouck
the secret service had no standard procedure for the systematic review of its requests for and receipt of information from other federal agencies
the commission believes that the facilities and procedures of the protective research section of the secret service
prior to november twenty two nineteen sixty three were inadequate
its efforts appear to have been too largely directed at the crank threat
although the service recognized that its advance preventive measures must encompass more than these most obvious dangers
it made little effort to identify factors in the activities of an individual
or an organized group other than specific threats which suggested a source of danger against which timely precautions could be taken
except for its special trip index file of four hundred names
none of the cases in the p r s general files was available for systematic review on a geographic basis when the president planned a particular trip
as reported in chapter two when the special file was reviewed on november eight
it contained the names of no persons from the entire dallas fort worth area
notwithstanding the fact that ambassador stevenson had been abused by pickets in dallas less than a month before
bouck explained the failure to try to identify the individuals involved in the stevenson incident after it occurred on the ground that
p r s required a more direct indication of a threat to the president and that there was no such indication until the president's scheduled visit to that area became known
such an approach seriously undermines the precautionary nature of p r s work
if the presence in dallas of the stevenson pickets might have created a danger for the president on a visit to that city
p r s should have investigated and been prepared to guard against it
other agencies occasionally provided information to the secret service concerning potentially dangerous political groups
this was done in the case of the nationalist party of puerto rico for example but only after members of the group had resorted to political violence
however the vague requests for information which the secret service made
to federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies were not well designed to elicit information from them
about persons other than those who were obvious threats to the president
the requests shifted the responsibility for evaluating difficult cases from the service the agency most responsible for performing that task
to the other agencies no specific guidance was provided
although the cia had on file requests from the treasury department for information on the counterfeiting of u s currency and certain smuggling matters
it had no written specification of intelligence information collected by cia abroad which was desired by the secret service
in advance of presidential trips outside the united states
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warren commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
chapter eight the protection of the president part two
information known about lee harvey oswald prior to the assassination
no information concerning lee harvey oswald appeared in p r s files before the president's trip to dallas
oswald was known to other federal agencies with which the secret service maintained intelligence liaison
the fbi had been interested in him to some degree at least since the time of his defection in october nineteen fifty nine
it had interviewed him twice shortly after his return to the united states again a year later at his request
and was investigating him at the time of the assassination the commission has taken the testimony of bureau agents
who interviewed oswald after his return from the soviet union and prior to november twenty two nineteen sixty three
the agent who was assigned his case at the time of the assassination the director of the fbi
and the assistant to the director in charge of all investigative activities under the director and associate director in addition
the director and deputy director for plans of the cia testified concerning that agency's limited knowledge of oswald before the assassination
finally the commission has reviewed the complete files on oswald as they existed at the time of the assassination of the department of state
the office of naval intelligence the fbi and the cia the information known to the fbi is summarized below
from defection to return to fort worth
the fbi opened a file on oswald in october nineteen fifty nine when news reports appeared of his defection to the soviet union
the file was opened quote
for the purpose of correlating information inasmuch as he was considered a possible security risk in the event he returned to this country end quote
oswald's defection was also the occasion for the opening of files by the department of state cia and the office of naval intelligence
until april nineteen sixty fbi activity consisted of placing in oswald's file
information regarding his relations with the u s embassy in moscow and background data relating largely to his prior military service
provided by other agencies
in april nineteen sixty misess marguerite oswald and robert oswald were interviewed
in the course of a routine fbi investigation of transfers of small sums of money from misess oswald to her son in russia
during the next two years the fbi continued to accumulate information
and kept itself informed on oswald's status by periodic reviews of state department and office of naval intelligence files
in this way it learned that when oswald had arrived in the soviet union
he had attempted to renounce his u s citizenship and applied for soviet citizenship
had described himself as a marxist had said he would give the soviet union any useful information he had acquired
as a marine radar technician and had displayed an arrogant and aggressive attitude at the u s embassy
it learned also that oswald had been discharged from the marine corps reserve as undesirable in august nineteen sixty
in june nineteen sixty two the bureau was advised by the department of state of oswald's plan to return to the united states
the bureau made arrangements to be advised by immigration authorities of his return
and instructed the dallas office to interview him when he got back to determine whether he had been recruited by a soviet intelligence service
oswald's file at the department of state passport office was reviewed in june nineteen sixty two
it revealed his letter of january thirty nineteen sixty two to secretary of the navy connally
in which he protested his discharge and declared that he would use quote all means end quote to correct it
the file reflected the department's determination that oswald had not expatriated himself
from return to fort worth to move to new orleans
oswald was first interviewed by fbi agents john w fain and b tom carter on june twenty six nineteen sixty two
agent fain reported to headquarters that oswald was impatient and arrogant
and unwilling to answer questions regarding his motive for going to the soviet union
oswald quote denied that he had ever denounced his u s citizenship and that he had ever applied for soviet citizenship specifically end quote
oswald was however willing to discuss his contacts with soviet authorities he denied having any involvement with soviet intelligence agencies
and promised to advise the fbi if he heard from them
agent fain was not satisfied by this interview and arranged to see oswald again on august sixteen nineteen sixty two
according to fain's contemporaneous memorandum and his present recollection
while oswald remained somewhat evasive at this interview he was not antagonistic and seemed generally to be settling down
marina oswald however recalled that her husband was upset by this interview
oswald again agreed to advise the fbi if he were approached under suspicious circumstances however he deprecated the possibility of this happening
particularly since his employment did not involve any sensitive information
having concluded that oswald was not a security risk or potentially dangerous or violent
fain determined that nothing further remained to be done at that time and recommended that the case be placed in a closed status
this is an administrative classification indicating that no further work has been scheduled
it does not preclude the agent in charge of the case from reopening it if he feels that further work should be done
from august nineteen sixty two
until march nineteen sixty three the fbi continued to accumulate information regarding oswald but engaged in no active investigation
agent fain retired from the fbi in october nineteen sixty two and the closed oswald case was not reassigned
however pursuant to a regular bureau practice of interviewing certain immigrants from iron curtain countries
fain had been assigned to see marina oswald at an appropriate time
this assignment was given to agent james p hosty junior of the dallas office upon fain's retirement
in march nineteen sixty three while attempting to locate marina oswald
agent hosty was told by misess m f tobias a former landlady of the oswalds at six oh two elsbeth street in dallas
that other tenants had complained because oswald was drinking to excess and beating his wife
this information led hosty to review oswald's file from which he learned that oswald had become a subscriber to the worker
a communist party publication
hosty decided that the lee harvey oswald case should be reopened because of the alleged personal difficulties and the contact with the worker
and his recommendation was accepted he decided however not to interview marina oswald at that time and merely determined
that the oswalds were living at two one four neely street in dallas
on april twenty one nineteen sixty three the fbi field office in new york
was advised that oswald was in contact with the fair play for cuba committee in new york and that he had written to the committee
stating that he had distributed its pamphlets on the streets of dallas this information did not reach agent hosty in dallas until june
hosty considered the information to be quote stale unquote by that time and did not attempt to verify oswald's reported statement
under a general bureau request to be on the alert for activities of the fair play for cuba committee
hosty had inquired earlier and found no evidence that it was functioning in the dallas area
in new orleans in the middle of may of nineteen sixty three agent hosty checked oswald's last known residence and found that he had moved
oswald was tentatively located in new orleans in june
and hosty asked the new orleans fbi office to determine oswald's address and what he was doing
the new orleans office investigated and located oswald learning his address and former place of employment on august five nineteen sixty three
a confidential informant advised the fbi that oswald was not known to be engaged in communist party activities in new orleans
on june twenty four oswald applied in new orleans for a passport stating that he planned to depart by ship
for an extended tour of western european countries the soviet union finland and poland
the passport office of the department of state in washington had no listing for oswald requiring special treatment
and his application was approved on the following day
the fbi had not asked to be informed of any effort by oswald to obtain a passport
as it might have under existing procedures and did not know of his application
according to the bureau quote
we did not request the state department to include oswald on a list which would have resulted in advising us of any application for a passport
inasmuch as the facts relating to oswald's activities at that time did not warrant such action
our investigation of oswald had disclosed no evidence that oswald was acting under the instructions or on behalf of
any foreign government or instrumentality thereof end quote
on august nine nineteen sixty three
oswald was arrested and jailed by the new orleans police department for disturbing the peace in connection with a street fight which broke out when he was accosted
by anti castro cubans while distributing leaflets on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee
on the next day he asked the new orleans police to arrange for him to be interviewed by the fbi
the police called the local fbi office and an agent john l quigley was sent to the police station
agent quigley did not know of oswald's prior fbi record when he interviewed him
inasmuch as the police had not given oswald's name to the bureau when they called the office
quigley recalled that oswald was receptive when questioned about his general background
but less than completely truthful or cooperative when interrogated about the fair play for cuba committee
quigley testified quote
when i began asking him specific details with respect to his activities in the fair play for cuba committee in new orleans as to where meetings were held
who was involved what occurred he was reticent to furnish information
reluctant and actually as far as i was concerned was completely evasive on them end quote
in quigley's judgment
oswald quote was probably making a self serving statement in attempting to explain to me why he was distributing this literature and for no other reason
and when i got to questioning him further then he felt that his purpose had been served and he wouldn't say anything further end quote
during the interview quigley obtained background information from oswald which was inconsistent with information already in the bureau's possession
when quigley returned to his office he learned
that another bureau agent milton r knack had been conducting a background investigation of oswald at the request of agent hosty in dallas
quigley advised knack of his interview and gave him a detailed memorandum
knack was aware of the facts known to the fbi and recognized oswald's false statements
for example oswald claimed that his wife's maiden name was prossa
and that they had been married in fort worth and lived there until coming to new orleans he had told the new orleans arresting officers that he had been born in cuba
several days later the bureau received additional evidence that oswald had lied to agent quigley
on august twenty two it learned that oswald had appeared on a radio discussion program on august twenty one
william stuckey who had appeared on the radio program with oswald told the bureau on august thirty
that oswald had told him that he had worked and been married in the soviet union
neither these discrepancies nor the fact that oswald had initiated the fbi interview
was considered sufficiently unusual to necessitate another interview alan h belmont assistant to the director of the fbi
stated the bureau's reasoning in this way quote
our interest in this man at this point was to determine whether his activities constituted a threat to the internal security of the country
it was apparent that he had made a self serving statement to agent quigley it became a matter of record in our files as a part of the case
and if we determined that the course of the investigation required us to clarify or face him down with this information we would do it at the appropriate time
in other words he committed no violation of the law by telling us something that wasn't true and unless this required further investigation at that time
we would handle it in due course in accord with the whole context of the investigation end quote
on august twenty one nineteen sixty three bureau headquarters instructed the new orleans and dallas field offices
to conduct an additional investigation of oswald in view of the activities which had led to his arrest
fbi informants in the new orleans area familiar with pro castro or communist party activity there
advised the bureau that oswald was unknown in such circles
in early september nineteen sixty three
the fbi transferred the principal responsibility for the oswald case from the dallas office to the new orleans office
soon after on october one nineteen sixty three
the fbi was advised by the rental agent for the oswalds apartment in new orleans that they had moved again
according to the information received by the bureau
they had vacated their apartment and marina oswald had departed with their child in a station wagon with texas registration
on october three hosty reopened the case in dallas to assist the new orleans office
he checked in oswald's old neighborhood and throughout the dallas fort worth area but was unable to locate oswald
the next word about oswald's location was a communication from the cia to the fbi on october ten
advising that an individual tentatively identified as oswald had been in touch with the soviet embassy in mexico city
in early october of nineteen sixty three
the bureau had no earlier information suggesting that oswald had left the united states
the possible contact with the soviet embassy in mexico intensified the fbi's interest in learning oswald's whereabouts
the fbi representative in mexico city arranged to follow up this information with the cia and to verify oswald's entry into mexico
the cia message was sent also to the department of state where it was reviewed by personnel of the passport office who knew from oswald's file
that he had sought and obtained a passport on june twenty five nineteen sixty three
the department of state did not advise either the cia or the fbi of these facts
on october twenty five
the new orleans office of the fbi learned that in september oswald had given a forwarding address of two five one five
west fifth street irving texas after receiving this information on october twenty nine agent hosty attempted to locate oswald
on the same day hosty interviewed neighbors on fifth street and learned that the address was that of misess ruth paine
he conducted a limited background investigation of the paines intending to interview misess paine and ask her particularly about oswald's whereabouts
having determined that misess paine was a responsible and reliable citizen hosty interviewed her on november one
the interview lasted about twenty to twenty five minutes in response to hosty's inquiries misess paine quote
readily admitted that misess marina oswald and lee oswald's two children were staying with her
she said that lee oswald was living somewhere in dallas she didn't know where she said it was in the oak cliff area but she didn't have his address
i asked her if she knew where he worked
after a moment's hesitation she told me that he worked at the texas school book depository near the downtown area of dallas
she didn't have the exact address and it is my recollection that we went to the phone book and looked it up
found it to be four one one elm street end quote
misess paine told hosty also
that oswald was living alone in dallas because she did not want him staying at her house although she was willing to let oswald visit his wife and children
according to hosty misess paine indicated that she thought she could find out where oswald was living and would let him know
at this point in the interview hosty gave misess paine his name and office telephone number on a piece of paper
at the end of the interview marina oswald came into the room when he observed that she seemed quote quite alarmed end quote about the visit
hosty assured her through misess paine as interpreter that the fbi would not harm or harass her
on november four hosty telephoned the texas school book depository and learned that oswald was working there
and that he had given as his address misess paine's residence in irving
hosty took the necessary steps to have the dallas office of the fbi rather than the new orleans office reestablished as the office with principal responsibility
on november five hosty was traveling near misess paine's home and took the occasion to stop by to ask whether she had any further information
misess paine had nothing to add to what she had already told him except that during a visit that past weekend
oswald had said that he was a quote trotskyite communist end quote
and that she found this and similar statements illogical and somewhat amusing on this occasion hosty was at the paine residence for only a few minutes
during neither interview did hosty learn oswald's address
or telephone number in dallas misess paine testified that she learned oswald's telephone number at the beckley street roominghouse in the middle of october
shortly after oswald rented the room on october fourteen
as discussed in chapter six she failed to report this to agent hosty
because she thought the fbi was in possession of a great deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn where oswald was living
hosty did nothing further in connection with the oswald case until after the assassination on november one nineteen sixty three
he had received a copy of the report of the new orleans office which contained agent quigley's memorandum of the interview in the new orleans jail on august ten
and realized immediately that oswald had given false biographic information hosty knew that he would eventually have to investigate this and quote
was quite interested in determining the nature of his contact with the soviet embassy in mexico city end quote
when asked what his next step would have been hosty replied quote
well as i had previously stated i have between twenty five and forty cases assigned to me at any one time i had other matters to take care of
i had now established that lee oswald was not employed in a sensitive industry
i can now afford to wait until new orleans forwarded the necessary papers to me to show me i now had all the information
it was then my plan to interview marina oswald in detail concerning both herself and her husband's background question
had you planned any steps beyond that point
answer no i would have to wait until i had talked to marina to see what i could determine and from there i could make my plans
question did you take any action on this case between november five and november twenty two answer no sir
the official bureau files confirm hosty's statement that from november five until the assassination no active investigation was conducted
on november eighteen the fbi learned that oswald recently had been in communication with the soviet embassy in washington
and so advised the dallas office in the ordinary course of business
hosty received this information on the afternoon of november twenty two nineteen sixty three
nonreferral of oswald to the secret service
the commission has considered carefully the question whether the fbi
in view of all the information concerning oswald in its files should have alerted the secret service to oswald's presence in dallas
prior to president kennedy's visit
the secret service and the fbi differ
as to whether oswald fell within the category of quote threats against the president end quote which should be referred to the service
robert i bouck special agent in charge of the protective research section
testified that the information available to the federal government about oswald before the assassination would if known to p r s
have made oswald a subject of concern to the secret service
bouck pointed to a number of characteristics besides oswald's defection the cumulative effect of which would have been to alert the secret service
to potential danger quote
i would think his continued association with the russian embassy after his return
his association with the castro groups would have been of concern to us a knowledge that he had i believe
been courtmartialed for illegal possession of a gun of a handgun in the marines
that he had owned a weapon and did a good deal of hunting or use of it perhaps in russia plus a number of items about his disposition and unreliability of character
i think all of those if we had them all together
would have added up to pointing out a pretty bad individual and i think that together had we known that he had a vantage point
would have seemed somewhat serious to us even though i must admit that none of these in themselves would be
would meet our specific criteria none of them alone but it is when you begin adding them up to some degree that you begin to get criteria that are meaningful
end quote mister bouck pointed out however that he had no reason to believe that any one federal agency had access to all this information
including the significant fact that oswald was employed in a building which overlooked the motorcade route
agent hosty testified that he was fully aware of the pending presidential visit to dallas
he recalled that the special agent in charge of the dallas office of the fbi j gordon shanklin
had discussed the president's visit on several occasions including the regular biweekly conference on the morning of november twenty two
quote mister shanklin advised us among other things
that in view of the president's visit to dallas that if anyone had any indication of any possibility of any acts of violence or any demonstrations against the president
or vice president to immediately notify the secret service and confirm it in writing
he had made the same statement about a week prior at another special conference which we had held
i don't recall the exact date it was about a week prior end quote
in fact hosty participated in transmitting to the secret service two pieces of information pertaining to the visit
hosty testified that he did not know until the evening of thursday november twenty one that there was to be a motorcade however
and never realized that the motorcade would pass the texas school book depository building
he testified that he did not read the newspaper story describing the motorcade route in detail since he was interested only in the fact
that the motorcade was coming up main street quote where maybe i could watch it if i had a chance end quote
even if he had recalled that oswald's place of employment was on the president's route
hosty testified that he would not have cited him to the secret service as a potential threat to the president hosty interpreted his instructions as requiring quote
some indication that the person planned to take some action against the safety of the president of the united states or the vice president end quote
in his opinion none of the information in the fbi files oswald's defection his fair play for cuba activities in new orleans
his lies to agent quigley his recent visit to mexico city indicated that oswald was capable of violence
hosty's initial reaction on hearing that oswald was a suspect in the assassination was quote shock
complete surprise end quote because he had no reason to believe that oswald quote
was capable or potentially an assassin of the president of the united states end quote
shortly after oswald was apprehended and identified hosty's superior sent him to observe the interrogation of oswald
hosty parked his car in the basement of police headquarters and there met an acquaintance lieutenant jack revill of the dallas police force
the two men disagree about the conversation which took place between them
they agree that hosty told revill
that the fbi had known about oswald and in particular of his presence in dallas and his employment at the texas school book depository building
revill testified that hosty said also that the fbi had information that oswald was quote capable of committing this assassination end quote
according to revill hosty indicated that he was going to tell this to lieutenant wells of the homicide and robbery bureau
revill promptly made a memorandum of this conversation in which the quoted statement appears
his secretary testified that she prepared such a report for him that afternoon and chief of police jesse e curry
and district attorney henry m wade both testified that they saw it later that day
hosty has unequivocally denied first by affidavit and then in his testimony before the commission
that he ever said that oswald was capable of violence or that he had any information suggesting this
the only witness to the conversation was dallas police detective v j brian who was accompanying revill
brian did not hear hosty make any statement concerning oswald's capacity to be an assassin
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warren commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
chapter eight the protection of the president part three
hosty's interpretation of the prevailing fbi instructions on referrals to the secret service was defended before the commission by his superiors
after summarizing the bureau's investigative interest in oswald prior to the assassination j edgar hoover concluded that quote
there was nothing up to the time of the assassination that gave any indication that this man was a dangerous character who might do harm to the president
or to the vice president end quote
director hoover emphasized that the first indication of oswald's capacity for violence
was his attempt on general walker's life which did not become known to the fbi until after the assassination
both director hoover and his assistant alan h belmont
stressed also the decision by the department of state that oswald should be permitted to return to the united states
neither believed that the bureau investigation of him up to november twenty two revealed any information which would have justified referral to the secret service
according to belmont when oswald returned from the soviet union quote
he indicated that he had learned his lesson
was disenchanted with russia and had a renewed concept i am paraphrasing a renewed concept of the american free society
we talked to him twice
he likewise indicated he was disenchanted with russia
we satisfied ourselves that we had met our requirement namely to find out whether he had been recruited by soviet intelligence the case was closed
we again exhibited interest on the basis of these contacts with the worker fair play for cuba committee which are relatively inconsequential
his activities for the fair play for cuba committee in new orleans we knew were not of real consequence as he was not connected with any organized activity there
the interview with him in jail is not significant from the standpoint of whether he had a propensity for violence
question this is the quigley interview you are talking about
answer yes it was a self serving interview the visits with the soviet embassy were evidently for the purpose of securing a visa
and he had told us during one of the interviews that he would probably take his wife back to soviet russia some time in the future
he had come back to dallas hosty had established that he had a job he was working
and had told misess paine that when he got the money he was going to take an apartment when the baby was old enough he was going to take an apartment and the family would live together
he gave evidence of settling down
nowhere during the course of this investigation or the information that came to us from other agencies was there any indication of a potential for violence on his part
consequently there was no basis for hosty to go to secret service and advise them of oswald's presence end quote
as reflected in this testimony
the officials of the fbi believed that there was no data in its files which gave warning that oswald was a source of danger to president kennedy
while he had expressed hostility at times toward the state department the marine corps and the fbi as agents of the government
so far as the fbi knew he had not shown any potential for violence
prior to november twenty two nineteen sixty three
no law enforcement agency had any information to connect oswald with the attempted shooting of general walker
it was against this background and consistent with the criteria followed by the fbi prior to november twenty two
that agents of the fbi in dallas did not consider oswald's presence in the texas school book depository building
overlooking the motorcade route as a source of danger to the president and did not inform the secret service of his employment in the depository building
the commission believes however
that the fbi took an unduly restrictive view of its responsibilities in preventive intelligence work prior to the assassination
the commission appreciates the large volume of cases handled by the fbi
six hundred thirty six thousand three hundred seventy one investigative matters during fiscal year nineteen sixty three
there were no secret service criteria which specifically required the referral of oswald's case to the secret service
nor was there any requirement to report the names of defectors however there was much material in the hands of the fbi about oswald
the knowledge of his defection his arrogance and hostility to the united states
his pro castro tendencies his lies when interrogated by the fbi
his trip to mexico where he was in contact with soviet authorities
his presence in the school book depository job and its location along the route of the motorcade
all this does seem to amount to enough to have induced an alert agency such as the fbi
possessed of this information to list oswald as a potential threat to the safety of the president
this conclusion may be tinged with hindsight but
it stated primarily to direct the thought of those responsible for the future safety of our presidents to the need for a more imaginative
and less narrow interpretation of their responsibilities
it is the conclusion of the commission that even in the absence of secret service criteria
which specifically required the referral of such a case as oswald's to the secret service
a more alert and carefully considered treatment of the oswald case by the bureau might have brought about such a referral
had such a review been undertaken by the fbi
there might conceivably have been additional investigation of the oswald case between november five and november twenty two
agent hosty testified
that several matters brought to his attention in late october and early november including the visit to the soviet embassy in mexico city
required further attention
under proper procedures knowledge of the pending presidential visit might have prompted hosty
to have made more vigorous efforts to locate oswald's roominghouse address in dallas and to interview him regarding these unresolved matters
the formal fbi instructions to its agents outlining the information to be referred to the secret service were too narrow at the time of the assassination
while the secret service bears the principal responsibility for this failure
the fbi instructions did not reflect fully the secret service's need for information regarding potential threats
the handbook referred thus to quote the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president end quote
it is clear from hosty's testimony that this was construed at least by him
as requiring evidence of a plan or conspiracy to injure the president
efforts made by the bureau since the assassination on the other hand
reflect keen awareness of the necessity of communicating a much wider range of intelligence information to the service
most important notwithstanding that both agencies have professed to the commission that the liaison between them was close and fully sufficient
the commission does not believe that the liaison between the fbi and the secret service prior to the assassination was as effective as it should have been
the fbi manual of instructions provided quote liaison with other government agencies
to insure adequate and effective liaison arrangements
each sac should specifically designate an agent or agents to be responsible for developing
and maintaining liaison with other federal agencies this liaison should take into consideration
fbi agency community of interests location of agency head quarters and the responsiveness of agency representatives
in each instance liaison contacts should be developed to include a close friendly relationship
mutual understanding of fbi and agency jurisdictions and an indicated willingness by the agency representative
to coordinate activities and to discuss problems of mutual interest
each field office should determine those federal agencies which are represented locally and with which liaison should be conducted end quote
the testimony reveals that liaison responsibilities in connection with the president's visit
were discussed twice officially by the special agent in charge of the fbi office in dallas as discussed in chapter two
some limited information was made available to the secret service but there was no fully adequate liaison between the two agencies indeed
the commission believes that the liaison between all federal agencies responsible for presidential protection should be improved
other protective measures and aspects of secret service performance
the president's trip to dallas called into play many standard operating procedures of the secret service in addition to its preventive intelligence operations
examination of these procedures shows that in most respects they were well conceived and ably executed by the personnel of the service
against the background of the critical events of november twenty two however
certain shortcomings and lapses from the high standards which the commission believes should prevail in the field of presidential protection are evident
advance preparations
the advance preparations in dallas by agent winston g lawson of the white house detail have been described in chapter two
with the assistance of agent in charge sorrels of the dallas field office of the secret service
lawson was responsible for working out a great many arrangements for the president's trip
the service prefers to have two agents perform advance preparations
in the case of dallas because president kennedy had scheduled visits to five texas cities
and had also scheduled visits to other parts of the country immediately before the texas trip
there were not enough men available to permit two agents to be assigned to all the advance work
agent lawson did the advance work alone from november thirteen to november eighteen when he was joined by agent david b grant
who had just completed advance work on the president's trip to tampa
the commission concludes that the most significant advance arrangements for the president's trip were soundly planned
in particular the commission believes that the motorcade route selected by agent lawson upon the advice of agent in charge sorrels
and with the concurrence of the dallas police was entirely appropriate in view of the known desires of the president
there were far safer routes via freeways directly to the trade mart
but these routes would not have been in accordance with the white house staff instructions given the secret service for a desirable motorcade route
much of lawson's time was taken with establishing adequate security over the motorcade route and at the two places where the president would stop
love field and the trade mart
by these secret service agents with the cooperation of the dallas police and other local law enforcement agents were carefully executed
since the president was to be at the trade mart longer than at any other location in dallas and in view of the security hazards presented by the building
the secret service correctly gave particular attention in the advance preparations to those arrangements
the commission also regards the security arrangements worked out by lawson and sorrels at love field as entirely adequate
the commission believes however
that the secret service has inadequately defined the responsibilities of its advance agents who have been given broad discretion
to determine what matters require attention in making advance preparations and to decide what action to take
agent lawson was not given written instructions concerning the dallas trip or advice about any peculiar problems which it might involve
all instructions from higher authority were communicated to him orally
he did not have a checklist of the tasks he was expected to accomplish either by his own efforts or with the cooperation of local authorities
the only systematic supervision of the activities of the advance agent
has been that provided by a requirement that he file interim and final reports on each advance assignment
the interim report must be in the hands of the agent supervising the protective group traveling with the president
long enough before his departure to apprise him of any particular problems encountered and the responsive action taken
agent lawson's interim report was received by agent kellerman on november twenty the day before departure on the texas trip
the secret service has advised the commission that no unusual precautions were taken for the dallas trip and that quote
the precautions taken for the president's trip were the usual safeguards employed on trips of this kind in the united states during the previous year end quote
special agent in charge sorrels testified that the advance preparations followed on this occasion were quote pretty much the same end quote
as those followed in nineteen thirty six during a trip to dallas by president roosevelt
which was sorrels first important assignment in connection with presidential work
in view of the constant change in the nature of threats to the president and the diversity of the dangers which may arise in the various cities within the united states
the commission believes that standard procedures in use for many years and applied in all parts of the country may not be sufficient
there is for example no secret service arrangement for evaluating before a trip particular difficulties that might be anticipated
which would bring to bear the judgment and experience of members of the white house detail other than the advance agent
constant reevaluation of procedures with attention to special problems and the development of instructions specific to particular trips
would be a desirable innovation
liaison with local law enforcement authorities
in the description of the important aspects of the advance preparations
there have been references to the numerous discussions between secret service representatives and the dallas police department
the wholehearted support of these local authorities was indispensable to the service in carrying out its duties
the service had twenty eight agents participating in the dallas visit
agent lawson's advance planning called for the deployment of almost six hundred members of the dallas police department
fire department county sheriff's department and the texas department of public safety
despite this dependence on local authorities which would be substantially the same on a visit by the president to any large city
the secret service did not at the time of the assassination have any established procedure governing its relationships with them
it had no prepared checklist of matters to be covered with local police on such visits to metropolitan areas
and no written description of the role the local police were expected to perform
discussions with the dallas authorities and requests made of them were entirely informal
the commission believes
that a more formal statement of assigned responsibilities supplemented in each case to reflect the peculiar conditions of each presidential trip
is essential this would help to eliminate varying interpretations of secret service instructions by different local law enforcement representatives for example
while the secret service representatives in dallas
asked the police to station guards at each overpass to keep quote unauthorized personnel end quote off this term was not defined
at some overpasses all persons were excluded
while on the overpass overlooking the assassination scene railroad and yard terminal workmen were permitted to remain under police supervision
as discussed in chapter three
assistant chief batchelor of the dallas police noted the absence of any formal statement by the secret service of specific work assigned to the police
and suggested the desirability of such a statement
agent lawson agreed that such a procedure would assist him and other agents in fulfilling their responsibilities as advance agents
check of buildings along route of motorcade
agent lawson did not arrange for a prior inspection of buildings along the motorcade route
either by police or by custodians of the buildings since it was not the usual practice of the secret service to do so
the chief of the service has provided the commission a detailed explanation of this policy quote
except for inauguration or other parades involving foreign dignitaries accompanied by the president in washington
it has not been the practice of the secret service to make surveys or checks of buildings along the route of a presidential motorcade
for the inauguration and certain other parades in washington where the traditional route is known to the public long in advance of the event
buildings along the route can be checked by teams of law enforcement officers and armed guards are posted along the route as appropriate
but on out of town trips where the route is decided on and made public only a few days in advance
buildings are not checked either by secret service agents or by any other law enforcement officers at the request of the secret service
with the number of men available to the secret service and the time available surveys of hundreds of buildings and thousands of windows is not practical
in dallas the route selected necessarily involved passing through the principal downtown section between tall buildings
while certain streets thought to be too narrow could be avoided and other choices made
it was not practical to select a route where the president could not be seen from roofs or windows of buildings
at the two places in dallas where the president would remain for a period of time love field and the trade mart
arrangements were made for building and roof security by posting police officers where appropriate
similar arrangements for a motorcade of ten miles including many blocks of tall commercial buildings is not practical
nor is it practical to prevent people from entering such buildings or to limit access in every building to those employed or having business there
even if it were possible with a vastly larger force of security officers to do so many observers have felt
that such a procedure would not be consistent with the nature and purpose of the motorcade to let the people see their president and to welcome him to their city
in accordance with its regular procedures no survey or other check was made by the secret service or by any other law enforcement agency at its request
of the texas school book depository building or those employed there prior to the time the president was shot end quote
this justification of the secret service's standing policy is not persuasive
the danger from a concealed sniper on the dallas trip was of concern to those who had considered the problem
president kennedy himself had mentioned it that morning as had agent sorrels when he and agent lawson were fixing the motorcade route
admittedly protective measures cannot ordinarily be taken with regard to all buildings along a motorcade route
levels of risk can be determined however as has been confirmed by building surveys made since the assassination for the department of the treasury
an attempt to cover only the most obvious points of possible ambush along the route in dallas might well have included the texas school book depository building
instead of such advance precautions the secret service depended in part on the efforts of local law enforcement personnel stationed along the route
in addition secret service agents riding in the motorcade were trained to scan buildings as part of their general observation of the crowd of spectators
these substitute measures were of limited value agent lawson was unable to state whether he had actually instructed
the dallas police to scan windows of buildings lining the motorcade route although it was his usual practice to do so
if such instructions were in fact given they were not effectively carried out
television films taken of parts of the motorcade by a dallas television station
show the foot patrolmen facing the passing motorcade and not the adjacent crowds and buildings as the procession passed
three officers from the dallas police department were assigned to the intersection of elm and houston
during the morning of november twenty two prior to the motorcade
all received their instructions early in the morning from captain p w lawrence of the traffic division
according to captain lawrence quote
i then told the officers that their primary duty was traffic and crowd control and that they should be alert for any persons who might attempt to throw anything
and although it was not a violation of the law to carry a placard that they were not to tolerate any actions such as the stevenson incident
and arrest any person who might attempt to throw anything or try to get at the president and his party
paying particular attention to the crowd for any unusual activity
i stressed the fact that this was our president and he should be shown every respect due his position and that it was our duty to see that this was done
end quote captain lawrence was not instructed to have his men watch buildings along the motorcade route and did not mention the observation of buildings to them
the three officers confirm that their primary concern was crowd and traffic control
and that they had no opportunity to scan the windows of the depository or any other building in the vicinity of elm and houston when the motorcade was passing
they had however occasionally observed the windows of buildings in the area before the motorcade arrived in accordance with their own understanding of their function
as the motorcade approached elm street
there were several secret service agents in it who shared the responsibility of scanning the windows of nearby buildings
agent sorrels riding in the lead car did observe the texas school book depository building as he passed by
at least for a sufficient number of seconds to gain a quote general impression end quote of the lack of any unusual activity
he was handicapped however by the fact that he was riding in a closed car whose roof at times obscured his view
lawson also in the lead car did not scan any buildings since an important part of his job was to look backward at the president's car
lawson stated that he quote was looking back a good deal of the time
watching his car watching the sides watching the crowds giving advice or asking advice from the chief
and also looking ahead to the known hazards like overpasses under passes railroads et cetera end quote
agent roy h kellerman riding in the front seat of the presidential car
stated that he scanned the depository building but not sufficiently to be alerted by anything in the windows or on the roof
the agents in the follow up car also were expected to scan adjacent buildings
however the commission does not believe that agents stationed in a car behind the presidential car
who must concentrate primarily on the possibility of threats from crowds along the route provide a significant safeguard against dangers in nearby buildings
conduct of secret service agents in fort worth on november twenty two
in the early morning hours on november twenty two nineteen sixty three
in fort worth there occurred a breach of discipline by some members of the secret service who were officially traveling with the president
after the president had retired at his hotel
nine agents who were off duty went to the nearby fort worth press club at midnight or slightly thereafter expecting to obtain food
they had little opportunity to eat during the day no food was available at the press club
all of the agents stayed for a drink of beer or in several cases a mixed drink
according to their affidavits the drinking in no case amounted to more than three glasses of beer or one and a half mixed drinks
and others who were present say that no agent was inebriated or acted improperly
the statements of the agents involved are supported by statements of members of the fort worth press who accompanied or observed them
and by a secret service investigation
according to their statements the agents remained at the press club for periods varying from thirty minutes to an hour and a half
and the last agent left the press club by two a m
two of the nine agents returned to their rooms the seven others proceeded to an establishment called the cellar coffee house
described by some as a beatnik place and by its manager as quote a unique showplace with continuous light entertainment all night
serving only coffee fruit juices and no hard liquors or beer end quote
there is no indication that any of the agents who visited the cellar coffee house had any intoxicating drink at that establishment
most of the agents were there from about one:thirty or one:forty five a m to about two:forty five or three a m
one agent was there from two until five a m
the lobby of the hotel and the areas adjacent to the quarters of the president were guarded during the night
by members of the midnight to eight a m shift of the white house detail
these agents were each relieved for a half hour break during the night
three members of this shift separately took this opportunity to visit the cellar coffee house
only one stayed as long as a half hour and none had any beverage there
chief rowley testified that agents on duty in such a situation usually stay within the building during their relief
but that their visits to the cellar were quote neither consistent nor inconsistent end quote with their duty
each of the agents who visited the press club or the cellar coffee house apart from the three members of the midnight shift
had duty assignments beginning no later than eight a m that morning
president kennedy was scheduled to speak across the street from his hotel in fort worth at eight:thirty a m
and then at a breakfast after which the entourage would proceed to dallas
in dallas one of the nine agents was assigned to assist in security measures at love field and four had protective assignments at the trade mart
the remaining four had key responsibilities as members of the complement of the follow up car in the motorcade
three of these agents occupied positions on the running boards of the car and the fourth was seated in the car
the supervisor of each of the off duty agents who visited the press club or the cellar coffee house
advised in the course of the secret service investigation of these events that each agent reported for duty on time
with full possession of his mental and physical capabilities and entirely ready for the performance of his assigned duties chief rowley testified that
as a result of the investigation he ordered he was satisfied that each of the agents performed his duties in an entirely satisfactory manner
and that their conduct the night before did not impede their actions on duty
or in the slightest way prevent them from taking any action that might have averted the tragedy
however chief rowley did not condone the action of the off duty agents particularly since it violated a regulation of the secret service
which provides quote liquor use of
a employees are strictly enjoined to refrain from the use of intoxicating liquor
during the hours they are officially employed at their post of duty or when they may reasonably expect that they may be called upon to perform an official duty
during entire periods of travel status
the special agent is officially employed and should not use liquor until the completion of all of his official duties for the day
after which time a very moderate use of liquor will not be considered a violation however all members of the white house detail
and special agents cooperating with them on presidential and similar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for official duty
at any time while in travel status
therefore the use of intoxicating liquor of any kind including beer and wine by members of the white house detail
and special agents cooperating with them or by special agents on similar assignments while they are in a travel status is prohibited end quote
the regulations provide further that quote violation or slight disregard end quote of these provisions quote
will be cause for removal from the service end quote
chief rowley testified
that under ordinary circumstances he would have taken disciplinary action against those agents who had been drinking in clear violation of the regulation
however he felt that any disciplinary action might have given rise
to an inference that the violation of the regulation had contributed to the tragic events of november twenty two
since he was convinced that this was not the case he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to take explicit disciplinary measures
he felt that each agent recognized the seriousness of the infraction and that there was no danger of a repetition
the commission recognizes that the responsibilities of members of the white house detail of the secret service are arduous
they work long hard hours under very great strain and must travel frequently
it might seem harsh to circumscribe their opportunities for relaxation
yet their role of protecting the president is so important to the well being of the country
that it is reasonable to expect them to meet very high standards of personal conduct
so that nothing can interfere with their bringing to their task the finest qualities and maximum resources of mind and body
this is the salutary goal to which the secret service regulation is directed
when it absolutely forbids drinking by any agent accompanying the president on a trip
nor is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep
it is conceivable that those men who had little sleep and who had consumed alcoholic beverages even in limited quantities
might have been more alert in the dallas motorcade if they had retired promptly in fort worth
however there is no evidence that these men failed to take any action in dallas within their power that would have averted the tragedy

chapter eight the protection of the president part four
the motorcade in dallas
rigorous security precautions had been arranged at love field with the local law enforcement authorities by agents sorrels and lawson
these precautions included reserving a ceremonial area for the presidential party
stationing police on the rooftops of all buildings overlooking the reception area
and detailing police in civilian clothes to be scattered throughout the sizable crowd
when president and misess kennedy shook hands with members of the public along the fences surrounding the reception area they were closely guarded by secret service agents
who responded to the unplanned event with dispatch
as described in chapter two the president directed that his car stop on two occasions during the motorcade so that he could greet members of the public
at these stops agents from the presidential follow up car stood between the president and the public
and on one occasion agent kellerman left the front seat of the president's car to take a similar position
the commission regards such impromptu stops as presenting an unnecessary danger
but finds that the secret service agents did all that could have been done to take protective measures
the presidential limousine
the limousine used by president kennedy in dallas was a convertible with a detachable rigid plastic bubble top
which was neither bulletproof nor bullet resistant
the last presidential vehicle with any protection against small arms fire left the white house in nineteen fifty three
it was not then replaced because the state of the art did not permit the development of a bulletproof top of sufficiently light weight
to permit its removal on those occasions when the president wished to ride in an open car
the secret service believed that it was very doubtful that any president would ride regularly in a vehicle with a fixed top even though transparent
since the assassination the secret service with the assistance of other federal agencies and of private industry
has developed a vehicle for the better protection of the president
access to passenger compartment of presidential car
on occasion the secret service has been permitted to have an agent riding in the passenger compartment with the president
presidents have made it clear however that they did not favor this or any other arrangement which interferes with the privacy of the president and his guests
the secret service has therefore suggested this practice only on extraordinary occasions
without attempting to prescribe or recommend specific measures which should be employed for the future protection of presidents
the commission does believe that there are aspects of the protective measures employed in the motorcade at dallas which deserve special comment
the presidential vehicle in use in dallas described in chapter two
had no special design or equipment which would have permitted the secret service agent riding in the driver's compartment
to move into the passenger section without hindrance or delay had the vehicle been so designed it is possible that an agent riding in the front seat
could have reached the president in time to protect him from the second and fatal shot to hit the president
however such access to the president was interfered with both by the metal bar some fifteen inches above the back of the front seat
and by the passengers in the jump seats
in contrast the vice presidential vehicle although not specially designed for that purpose
had no passenger in a jump seat between agent youngblood and vice president johnson to interfere with agent youngblood's ability
to take a protective position in the passenger compartment before the third shot was fired
the assassination suggests that it would have been of prime importance
in the protection of the president if the presidential car permitted immediate access to the president by a secret service agent at the first sign of danger
at that time the agents on the framing boards of the follow up car were expected to perform such a function
however these agents could not reach the president's car when it was traveling at an appreciable rate of speed
even if the car is traveling more slowly the delay involved in reaching the president may be crucial
it is clear that at the time of the shots in dallas agent clinton j hill leaped to the president's rescue as quickly as humanly possible
even so analysis of the motion picture films taken by amateur photographer zapruder
reveals that hill first placed his hand on the presidential car at frame three forty three thirty frames
and therefore approximately one point six seconds after the president was shot in the head
about three point seven seconds after the president received this wound
hill had both feet on the car and was climbing aboard to assist president and misess kennedy
planning for motorcade contingencies
in response to inquiry by the commission regarding the instructions to agents in a motorcade
of emergency procedures to be taken in a contingency such as that which actually occurred the secret service responded quote
the secret service has consistently followed two general principles in emergencies involving the president
all agents are so instructed
the first duty of the agents in the motorcade is to attempt to cover the president as closely as possible and practicable
and to shield him by attempting to place themselves between the president and any source of danger
secondly agents are instructed to remove the president as quickly as possible from known or impending danger
agents are instructed that it is not their responsibility to investigate or evaluate a present danger
but to consider any untoward circumstances as serious and to afford the president maximum protection at all times
no responsibility rests upon those agents near the president for the identification or arrest of any assassin or an attacker
their primary responsibility is to stay with and protect the president
beyond these two principles the secret service believes a detailed contingency or emergency plan is not feasible
because the variations possible preclude effective planning
a number of steps are taken however to permit appropriate steps to be taken in an emergency
for instance the lead car always is manned by secret service agents familiar with the area and with local law enforcement officials
the radio net in use in motorcades is elaborate and permits a number of different means of communication with various local points
a doctor is in the motorcade
this basic approach to the problem of planning for emergencies is sound
any effort to prepare detailed contingency plans might well have the undesirable effect of inhibiting quick and imaginative responses
if the advance preparation is thorough and the protective devices and techniques employed are sound
those in command should be able to direct the response appropriate to the emergency the commission finds that the secret service agents in the motorcade
who were immediately responsible for the president's safety reacted promptly at the time the shots were fired
their actions demonstrate that the president and the nation can expect courage and devotion to duty from the agents of the secret service
recommendations
the commission's review of the provisions for presidential protection at the time of president kennedy's trip to dallas demonstrates the need for substantial improvements
since the assassination the secret service and the department of the treasury
have properly taken the initiative in reexamining major aspects of presidential protection
many changes have already been made and others are contemplated some of them in response to the commission's questions and informal suggestions
assassination a federal crime
there was no federal criminal jurisdiction over the assassination of president kennedy
had there been reason to believe that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy federal jurisdiction could have been asserted
it has long been a federal crime to conspire to injure any federal officer on account of or while he is engaged in the lawful discharge of the duties of his office
murder of the president has never been covered by federal law however so that once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a single person
the state of texas had exclusive jurisdiction
it is anomalous that congress has legislated in other ways touching upon the safety of the chief executive or other federal officers
without making an attack on the president a crime threatening harm to the president is a federal offense
as is advocacy of the overthrow of the government by the assassination of any of its officers
the murder of federal judges u s attorneys and marshals and a number of other specifically designated
federal law enforcement officers is a federal crime
equally anomalous are statutory provisions which specifically authorize the secret service to protect the president
without authorizing it to arrest anyone who harms him the same provisions authorize the service to arrest without warrant
persons committing certain offenses including counterfeiting and certain frauds involving federal checks or securities
the commission agrees with the secret service that it should be authorized to make arrests without warrant
for all offenses within its jurisdiction as are fbi agents and federal marshals
there have been a number of efforts to make assassination a federal crime particularly after the assassination of president mckinley
and the attempt on the life of president elect franklin d roosevelt
in nineteen oh two bills passed both houses of congress but failed of enactment when the senate refused to accept the conference report
a number of bills were introduced immediately following the assassination of president kennedy
the commission recommends to the congress that it adopt legislation which would
punish the murder or manslaughter of attempt or conspiracy to murder kidnaping of and assault upon
the president vice president or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of president the president elect and the vice president elect
whether or not the act is committed while the victim is in the performance of his official duties or on account of such performance
such a statute would cover the president and vice president or in the absence of a vice president the person next in order of succession
during the period between election and inauguration the president elect and vice president elect would also be covered
restricting the coverage in this way would avoid unnecessary controversy over the inclusion or exclusion of other officials who are in the order of succession
or who hold important governmental posts
in addition the restriction would probably eliminate a need for the requirement which has been urged as necessary for the exercise of federal power
that the hostile act occur while the victim is engaged in or because of the performance of official duties
the governmental consequences of assassination of one of the specified officials give the united states ample power to act for its own protection
the activities of the victim at the time an assassination occurs and the motive for the assassination
bear no relationship to the injury to the united states which follows from the act
this point was ably made in the nineteen oh two debate by senator george f hoar the sponsor of the senate bill quote
what this bill means to punish is the crime of interruption of the government of the united states and the destruction of its security by striking down the life
of the person who is actually in the exercise of the executive power or
of such persons as have been constitutionally and lawfully provided to succeed thereto in case of a vacancy it is important to this country
that the interruption shall not take place for an hour end quote
enactment of this statute would mean that the investigation of any of the acts covered and of the possibility of a further attempt
would be conducted by federal law enforcement officials in particular the fbi with the assistance of the secret service
at present federal agencies participate only upon the sufferance of the local authorities
while the police work of the dallas authorities in the early identification and apprehension of oswald was both efficient and prompt
fbi director j edgar hoover who strongly supports such legislation testified that the absence of clear federal jurisdiction
over the assassination of president kennedy led to embarrassment and confusion in the subsequent investigation by federal and local authorities
in addition the proposed legislation will insure
that any suspects who are arrested will be federal prisoners subject to federal protection from vigilante justice and other threats
committee of cabinet officers as our government has become more complex
agencies other than the secret service have become involved in phases of the overall problem of protecting our national leaders
the fbi is the major domestic investigating agency of the united states
while the cia has the primary responsibility for collecting intelligence overseas to supplement information acquired by the department of state
the secret service must rely in large part
the commission believes that it is necessary to improve the cooperation among these agencies
and to emphasize that the task of presidential protection is one of broad national concern
the commission suggests that consideration might be given to assigning to a cabinet level committee or the national security council
which is responsible for advising the president respecting the coordination
of departmental policies relating to the national security the responsibility to review and oversee the protective activities of the secret service
and the other federal agencies that assist in safeguarding the president the committee should include the secretary of the treasury and the attorney general
and if the council is used arrangements should be made for the attendance of the secretary of the treasury
and the attorney general at any meetings which are concerned with presidential protection
the council already includes in addition to the president and vice president the secretaries of state and defense and has a competent staff
the foremost assignment of the committee would be to insure that the maximum resources of the federal government are fully engaged in the job of protecting the president
by defining responsibilities clearly and overseeing their execution
major needs of personnel or other resources might be met more easily on its recommendation than they have been in the past
the committee would be able to provide guidance in defining the general nature of domestic and foreign dangers to presidential security
as improvements are recommended for the advance detection of potential threats to the president it could act as a final review board
the expert assistance and resources which it could draw upon would be particularly desirable in this complex and sensitive area
this arrangement would provide a continuing high level contact for agencies that may wish to consult respecting particular protective measures
for various reasons the secret service has functioned largely as an informal part of the white house staff with the result
that it has been unable as a practical matter to exercise sufficient influence over the security precautions which surround presidential activities
a cabinet level committee which is actively concerned with these problems would be able to discuss these matters more effectively with the president
responsibilities for presidential protection
the assignment of the responsibility of protecting the president to an agency of the department of the treasury was largely an historical accident
the secret service was organized as a division of the department of the treasury in eighteen sixty five to deal with counterfeiting
in eighteen ninety four
while investigating a plot to assassinate president cleveland the service assigned a small protective detail of agents to the white house
secret service men accompanied the president and his family to their vacation home in massachusetts
and special details protected him in washington on trips and at special functions
these informal and part time arrangements led to more systematic protection in nineteen oh two after the assassination of president mckinley
the secret service then the only federal investigative agency assumed full time responsibility for the safety of the president
since that time the secret service has had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of the president
and also for the preventive investigation of potential threats against the president
although the secret service has had the primary responsibility for the protection of the president
the fbi which was established within the department of justice in nineteen oh eight has had in recent years an increasingly important role to play
in the appropriations of the fbi there has recurred annually an item for the quote protection of the person of the president of the united states end quote
which first appeared in the appropriation of the department of justice in nineteen ten under the heading quote miscellaneous objects end quote
although the fbi is not charged with the physical protection of the president it does have an assignment as do other government agencies
in the field of preventive investigation in regard to the president's security
as discussed above the bureau has attempted to meet its responsibilities in this field by spelling out in its handbook
the procedures which its agents are to follow in connection with information received quote
indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president end quote or other protected persons
with two federal agencies operating in the same general field of preventive investigation
questions inevitably arise as to the scope of each agency's authority and responsibility
as the testimony of j edgar hoover and other bureau officials revealed the fbi did not believe that its directive required the bureau
to notify the secret service of the substantial information about lee harvey oswald which the fbi had accumulated
before the president reached dallas
on the other hand the secret service had no knowledge whatever of oswald his background or his employment at the book depository
and robert i bouck who was in charge of the protective research section of the secret service believed that the accumulation of the facts known to the fbi
should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the secret service of the oswald risk
the commission believes that both the fbi and the secret service have too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities
the commission has the impression
that too much emphasis is placed by both on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not enough on dangers from other sources
in addition the commission has concluded that the secret service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information
regarding such threats and that its protective research section is not adequately staffed or equipped
to conduct the wider investigative work that is required today for the security of the president
during the period the commission was giving thought to this situation
the commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the president
these proposals included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases of the work
in one or another government agency to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved and to retain the existing system
but expand both the scope and the operations of the existing agencies particularly those of the secret service and the fbi
it has been pointed out that the fbi as our chief investigative agency
is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive information gathering functions within the united states
it was also suggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the secret service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet the problem
consequently the suggestion has been made on the one hand that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of the president
should be transferred to the fbi
leaving with the secret service only the responsibility for the physical protection of the president that is the guarding function alone
on the other hand it is urged that all features of the protection of the president and his family should be committed to an elite and independent corps
it is also contended that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the presidential family
in all its ramifications and alert to every danger that might befall it
and ready at any instant to hazard great danger to themselves in the performance of their tremendous responsibility
it is suggested that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the president
and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage
incident to its responsibilities
so circumscribed it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary alertness for this unique and challenging responsibility
while in accordance with its mandate
this commission has necessarily examined into the functioning of the various federal agencies concerned with the tragic trip of president kennedy to dallas
and while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect thereto it seems clear
that it was not within the commission's responsibility to make specific recommendations as to the long range organization of the president's protection
except as conclusions flowing directly from its examination of the president's assassination can be drawn
the commission was not asked to apply itself as did the hoover commission in nineteen forty nine
for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the president's protection
it would have been necessary for the commission to take considerable testimony much of it extraneous to the facts of the assassination of president kennedy
to put it in a position to reach final conclusions in this respect
there are always dangers of divided responsibility
duplication and confusion of authority where more than one agency is operating in the same field but on the other hand
the protection of the president is in a real sense a government wide responsibility which must necessarily assumed by the department of state
the fbi the cia and the military intelligence agencies as well as the secret service
moreover a number of imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change in the intimate association now established
between the secret service and the president and his family is contemplated
these considerations have induced the commission to believe
that the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of responsibilities and functions should be left to the executive and the congress
perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the cabinet level committee recommended above or the national security council
pending any such determination however this commission is convinced of the necessity of better coordination
and direction of the activities of all existing agencies of government which are in a position to and do furnish information
and services related to the security of the president
the commission feels the secret service and the fbi as well as the state department and the cia when the president travels abroad
could improve their existing capacities and procedures so as to lessen the chances of assassination
without therefore coming to final conclusions respecting the long range organization of the president's security
the commission believes that the facts of the assassination of president kennedy point to certain measures which
while assuming no radical relocation of responsibilities
can and should be recommended by this commission in the interest of the more efficient protection of the president

by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy chapter eight the protection of the president part five
general supervision of the secret service
the intimacy of the secret service's relationship to the white house
and the dissimilarity of its protective functions to most activities of the department of the treasury
have made it difficult for the treasury to maintain close and continuing supervision
the commission believes that the recommended cabinet level committee will help to correct many of the major deficiencies of supervision
disclosed by the commission's investigation other measures should be taken as well to improve the overall operation of the secret service
daily supervision of the operations of the secret service within the department of the treasury should be improved
the chief of the service now reports to the secretary of the treasury
through an assistant secretary whose duties also include the direct supervision of the bureau of the mint
and the department's employment policy program and who also represents the secretary of the treasury on various committees and groups
the incumbent has no technical qualifications in the area of presidential protection
the commission recommends that the secretary of the treasury appoint a special assistant with the responsibility of supervising the service
this special assistant should be required to have sufficient stature and experience in law enforcement intelligence or allied fields
to be able to provide effective continuing supervision
and to keep the secretary fully informed regarding all significant developments relating to presidential protection
this report has already pointed out several respects
in which the commission believes that the secret service has operated with insufficient planning or control
actions by the service since the assassination indicate its awareness of the necessity for substantial improvement in its administration
a formal and thorough description of the responsibilities of the advance agent is now in preparation by the service
work is going forward
toward the preparation of formal understandings of the respective roles of the secret service and other agencies with which it collaborates
or from which it derives assistance and support
the commission urges that the service continue this effort to overhaul and define its procedures
while manuals and memoranda are no guarantee of effective operations
no sizable organization can achieve efficiency without the careful analysis and demarcation of responsibility
that is reflected in definite and comprehensive operating procedures
the commission also recommends
that the secret service consciously set about the task of inculcating and maintaining the highest standard of excellence and esprit for all of its personnel
this involves tight and unswerving discipline as well as the promotion of an outstanding degree of dedication and loyalty to duty
the commission emphasizes that it finds no causal connection between the assassination
and the breach of regulations which occurred on the night of november twenty one at fort worth
nevertheless such a breach in which so many agents participated
is not consistent with the standards which the responsibilities of the secret service require it to meet
preventive intelligence
in attempting to identify those individuals who might prove a danger to the president
the secret service has largely been the passive recipient of threatening communications to the president
and reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information for potential sources of danger
this was the consequence of the service's lack of an adequate investigative staff
its inability to process large amounts of data and its failure to provide specific descriptions of the kind of information it sought
the secret service has embarked upon a complete overhaul of its research activities the staff of the protective research section p r s
has been augmented and a secret service inspector has been put in charge of this operation with the assistance of the president's office of science and technology
and of the advanced research projects agency of the department of defense
it has obtained the services of outside consultants such as the rand corporation
international business machines corporation and a panel of psychiatric and psychological experts
it has received assistance also from data processing experts at the cia
and from a specialist in psychiatric prognostication at walter reed hospital
as a result of these studies the planning document submitted by the secretary of the treasury to the bureau of the budget on august thirty one
nineteen sixty four makes several significant recommendations in this field
based on the commission's investigation the following minimum goals for improvements are indicated
broader and more selective criteria
since the assassination both the secret service and the fbi have recognized
that the p r s files can no longer be limited largely to persons communicating actual threats to the president
on december twenty six nineteen sixty three the fbi circulated additional instructions to all its agents
specifying criteria for information to be furnished to the secret service in addition to that covered by the former standard
which was the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president
he new instructions require fbi agents to report immediately information concerning quote
subversives ultrarightists racists and fascists a possessing emotional instability or irrational behavior
b who have made threats of bodily harm against officials or employees of federal state or local government or officials of a foreign government
c who express or have expressed strong or violent anti u s sentiments
and who have been involved in bombing or bomb making or whose past conduct indicates tendencies toward violence and d
whose prior acts or statements depict propensity for violence and hatred against organized government end quote
alan h belmont assistant to the director of the fbi testified that this revision was initiated by the fbi itself
the volume of references to the secret service has increased substantially since the new instructions went into effect
more than five thousand names were referred to the secret service in the first four months of nineteen sixty four
according to chief rowley by mid june nineteen sixty four
the secret service had received from the fbi some nine thousand reports on members of the communist party
the fbi now transmits information on all defectors a category which would of course have included oswald
both director hoover and belmont expressed to the commission the great concern of the fbi which is shared by the secret service
that referrals to the secret service under the new criteria might if not properly handled
result in some degree of interference with the personal liberty of those involved
they emphasized the necessity that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment and care
the commission shares this concern
the problem is aggravated by the necessity that the service obtain the assistance of local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it receives
and in taking preventive steps
in june nineteen sixty four the secret service sent to a number of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
guidelines for an experimental program to develop more detailed criteria
the suggestions of federal agencies for revision of these guidelines were solicited
the new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that
the interest of the secret service goes beyond information on individuals or groups threatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the president
information is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have demonstrated an interest in the president
or quote other high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means
other than legal or peaceful to satisfy any grievance real or imagined
under these criteria whether the case should be referred to the secret service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability
propensity toward violent action or some similar characteristic coupled with some evaluation of the capability of the individual or group
to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means
while these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction
they seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of animus against a government official
it is questionable whether such criteria would have resulted in the referral of oswald to the secret service
chief rowley believed that they would
because of oswald's demonstrated hostility toward the secretary of the navy in his letter of january thirty nineteen sixty two quote
i shall employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice to a bona fide u s citizen and ex service man
the u s government has no charges or complaints against me
i ask you to look into this case and take the necessary steps to repair the damage done to me and my family end quote
even with the advantage of hindsight this letter does not appear to express or imply oswald's quote
determination to use a means other than legal or peaceful to satisfy his grievance end quote within the meaning of the new criteria
it is apparent that a good deal of further consideration and experimentation will be required before adequate criteria can be framed
the commission recognizes that no set of meaningful criteria will yield the names of all potential assassins charles j guiteau
leon f czolgosz
john schrank and guiseppe zangara four assassins or would be assassins
were all men who acted alone in their criminal acts against our leaders none had a serious record of prior violence
each of them was a failure in his work and in his relations with others a victim of delusions and fancies which led to the conviction
that society and its leaders had combined to thwart him it will require every available resource of our government
to devise a practical system which has any reasonable possibility of revealing such malcontents
liaison with other agencies regarding intelligence
the secret service's liaison with the agencies that supply information to it has been too casual
since the assassination the service has recognized that these relationships must be far more formal
and each agency given clear understanding of the assistance which the secret service expects
once the secret service has formulated its new standards for collection of information it should enter into written agreements with each federal agency
and the leading state and local agencies that might be a source of such information
such agreements should describe in detail the information which is sought the manner in which it will be provided to the secret service
and the respective responsibilities for any further investigation that may be required
this is especially necessary with regard to the fbi and cia
which carry the major responsibility for supplying information about potential threats
particularly those arising from organized groups within their special jurisdiction
since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups
they should be responsible for advising the secret service if information develops indicating the existence of an assassination plot
and for reporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate that the group may present a danger to the president
detailed formal agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between the secret service and both of these agencies
it should be made clear that the secret service will in no way seek to duplicate the intelligence
and investigative capabilities of the agencies now operating in this field but will continue
to use the data developed by these agencies to carry out its special duties
once experience has been gained in implementing such agreements with the federal and leading state and local agencies
the secret service through its field offices
should negotiate similar arrangements with such other state and local law enforcement agencies as may provide meaningful assistance
much useful information will come to the attention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of their activities
and this source should not be neglected by undue concentration on relationships with other federal agencies
finally these agreements with federal and local authorities will be of little value
unless a system is established for the frequent formal review of activities thereunder in this regard
the commission notes with approval several recent measures taken and proposed by the secret service to improve its liaison arrangements
in his testimony secretary of the treasury c douglas dillon informed the commission
that an interagency committee has been established to develop more effective criteria
according to secretary dillon
the committee will include representatives of the president's office of science and technology department of defense cia
fbi and the secret service
in addition the department of the treasury has requested five additional agents for its protective research section
to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement and intelligence agencies on the basis of the department's review during the past several months
secretary dillon testified that the use of such liaison officers is the only effective way to insure that adequate liaison is maintained
as a beginning step to improve liaison with local law enforcement officials the secret service on august twenty six nineteen sixty four
directed its field representatives to send a form request for intelligence information to all local
county and state law enforcement agencies in their districts
each of these efforts appears sound
and the commission recommends that these and the other measures suggested by the commission be pursued vigorously by secret service
automatic data processing
unless the secret service is able to deal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data
the increased information supplied by other agencies will be wasted
p r s must develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis than the present geographic breakdown
its present manual filing system is obsolete
it makes no use of the recent developments in automatic data processing which are widely used in the business world and in other government offices
the secret service and the department of the treasury now recognize this critical need
in the planning document currently under review by the bureau of the budget the department recommends that it be permitted to hire five qualified persons quote
to plan and develop a workable and efficient automated file and retrieval system end quote
also the department requests the sum of one hundred thousand dollars to conduct a detailed feasibility study
this money would be used to compensate consultants to lease standard equipment or to purchase specially designed pilot equipment
on the basis of such a feasibility study
the department hopes to design a practical system which will fully meet the needs of the protective research section of the secret service
the commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request
the commission further recommends that the secret service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the federal agencies from which it receives information
the secret service should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other federal agencies
in planning its data processing techniques
the secret service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come note
in evaluating data processing techniques of the secret service
the commission had occasion to become informed to a limited extent about the data processing techniques of other federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies
the commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort on an interagency basis
to develop coordinated and mutually compatible systems even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent
with the particular purposes of the agency involved the commission recognizes that this is a controversial area
and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination
this matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the commission
but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action
the commission therefore recommends that the president consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility
that coordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be contemplated without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved
protective research participation in advance arrangements
since the assassination secret service procedures have been changed to require that a member of p r s accompany each advance survey team
to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from them
this p r s agent will also be responsible for establishing an informal local liaison committee
to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are coordinated
based on its experience during this period the secret service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to p r s
so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the service's field offices
the commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued
liaison with local law enforcement agencies
advice by the secret service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a presidential visit
has hitherto been handled on an informal basis
the service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a presidential visit to a city
in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities
thus the local chief of police could be given a master plan prepared for the occasion of all protective measures to be taken during the visit
each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him the secret service has expressed concern
that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers to the prejudice of the precautions described
however the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing
more importantly the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities
can lead to lapses in protection such as the confusion in dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses
such instructions will not fit all circumstances of course
and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases
inspection of buildings
since the assassination of president kennedy the secret service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route
according to secretary dillon
the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others
the commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route
the secret service should utilize the personnel of other federal law enforcement offices
in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task as it is now doing
lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions
in this crucial area of presidential protection
secret service personnel and facilities
testimony and other evidence before the commission
suggest that the secret service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment
although chief rowley does not complain about the pay scale for secret service agents
salaries are below those of the fbi and leading municipal police forces
the assistant to the director of the fbi testified that
the caseload of each fbi agent averaged twenty to twenty five and he felt that this was high
chief rowley testified that the present workload of each secret service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases
while these statistics relate to the activities of secret service agents stationed in field offices and not the white house detail
field agents supplement those on the detail particularly when the president is traveling
although the commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable
these figures suggest that the agents of the secret service are substantially overworked
in its budget request for the fiscal year beginning july one nineteen sixty four
the secret service sought funds for twenty five new positions primarily in field offices this increase has been approved by the congress
chief rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required
however the nineteen sixty four to sixty five budget request was submitted in november nineteen sixty three
and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted
the secret service has now presented its recommendations to the bureau of the budget the plan proposed by the service
would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period
the plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the secret service seventeen of this number are proposed for the protective research section
one hundred forty five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
and be available to protect the president or vice president when they travel
eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the white house detail
in case of unexpected need and twenty five additional agents are recommended to provide the vice president full protection
the commission urges that the bureau of the budget review these recommendations with the secret service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation
as soon as it can be justified the congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the president
manpower and technical assistance from other agencies
before the assassination the secret service infrequently requested other federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
to assist in its protection functions
since the assassination the service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies
it has used other treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the president frequently travels
it has also used other federal law enforcement agents during presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed
thus in the four months following the assassination
the fbi on sixteen separate occasions supplied a total of one hundred thirty nine agents to assist in protection work during a presidential visit
which represents a departure from its prior practice
from february eleven through june thirty nineteen sixty four
the service had the advantage of nine thousand five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies
the fbi has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available
even though it agrees with the secret service that it is preferable for the service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands
the commission endorses these efforts to supplement the service's own personnel by obtaining for short periods of time
the assistance of trained federal law enforcement officers
in view of the ever increasing mobility of american presidents it seems unlikely that the service could or should increase its own staff to a size
which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations
the commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide and that each such agency
and the secret service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements
it may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an executive order
the secret service will be better able to plan its own long range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies
the occasional use of personnel from other federal agencies to assist in protecting the president has a further advantage it symbolizes the reality
that the job of protecting the president has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the secret service
the secret service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the chief executive
this no longer appears to be the case
protecting the president is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our government
recognition that the responsibility must be shared increases the likelihood that it will be met
much of the secret service work requires the development and use of highly sophisticated equipment
some of which must be specially designed to fit unique requirements even before the assassination and to a far greater extent thereafter
the secret service has been receiving full cooperation in scientific research and technological development
from many government agencies including the department of defense and the president's office of science and technology
even if the manpower and technological resources of the secret service are adequately augmented
it will continue to rely in many respects upon the greater resources of the office of science and technology and other agencies
the commission recommends that the present arrangements
with the office of science and technology and the other federal agencies that have been so helpful to the secret service be placed on a permanent and formal basis
the exchange of letters dated august thirty one nineteen sixty four
between secretary dillon and donald f hornig special assistant to the president for science and technology is a useful effort in the right direction
the service should negotiate a memorandum of understanding with each agency that has been assisting it and from which it can expect to need help in the future
the essential terms of such memoranda might well be embodied in an executive order
this commission can recommend no procedures for the future protection of our presidents which will guarantee security
the demands on the president in the execution of his responsibilities in today's world are so varied and complex
and the traditions of the office in a democracy such as ours are so deep seated as to preclude absolute security
the commission has however from its examination of the facts of president kennedy's assassination
made certain recommendations which it believes would if adopted
materially improve upon the procedures in effect at the time of president kennedy's assassination and result in a substantial lessening of the danger
as has been pointed out the commission has not resolved all the proposals which could be made the commission nevertheless is confident that
with the active cooperation of the responsible agencies and with the understanding of the people of the united states in their demands upon their president
the recommendations we have here suggested would greatly advance the security of the office without any impairment of our fundamental liberties
