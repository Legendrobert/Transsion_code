oswald did not always distinguish between marxism and communism
he stated several times that he was a communist but apparently never joined any communist party
his attachment to marxist and communist doctrine was probably in some measure an expression of his hostility to his environment
while there is doubt about how fully oswald understood the doctrine which he so often espoused it seems clear
that his commitment to marxism was an important factor influencing his conduct during his adult years
it was an obvious element in his decision to go to russia and later to cuba and it probably influenced his decision to shoot at general walker
it was a factor which contributed to his character and thereby might have influenced his decision to assassinate president kennedy
the discussion below will describe the events known to the commission which most clearly reveals the formation and nature of oswald's character
it will attempt to summarize the events of his early life his experience in new york city and in the marine corps and his interest in marxism
it will examine his defection to the soviet union in nineteen fifty nine his subsequent return to the united states and his life here
after june of nineteen sixty two
the review of the latter period will evaluate his personal and employment relations his attempt to kill general walker his political activities
and his unsuccessful attempt to go to cuba in late september of nineteen sixty three
various possible motives will be treated in the appropriate context of the discussion outlined above
the early years
significant in shaping the character of lee harvey oswald was the death of his father a collector of insurance premiums
this occurred two months before lee was born in new orleans on october eighteen nineteen thirty nine
that death strained the financial fortunes of the remainder of the oswald family
it had its effect on lee's mother marguerite his brother robert who had been born in nineteen thirty four
and his half brother john pic who had been born in nineteen thirty two during marguerite's previous marriage
it forced marguerite oswald to go to work to provide for her family
reminding her sons that they were orphans and that the family's financial condition was poor
she placed john pic and robert oswald in an orphans home
from the time marguerite oswald returned to work until december twenty six nineteen forty two when lee too was sent to the orphans home
he was cared for principally by his mother's sister by babysitters and by his mother when she had time for him
marguerite oswald withdrew lee from the orphans home and took him with her to dallas when he was a little over four years old
about six months later she also withdrew john pic and robert oswald
apparently that action was taken in anticipation of her marriage to edwin a ekdahl which took place in may of nineteen forty five
in the fall of that year john pic and robert oswald went to a military academy
where they stayed except for vacations until the spring of nineteen forty eight
lee oswald remained with his mother and ekdahl to whom he became quite attached
john pic testified that he thought lee found in ekdahl the father that he never had
that situation however was short lived
for the relations between marguerite oswald and ekdahl were stormy and they were finally divorced after several separations and reunions
in the summer of nineteen forty eight
after the divorce misess oswald complained considerably about how unfairly she was treated
dwelling on the fact that she was a widow with three children
john pic however did not think her position was worse than that of many other people
in the fall of nineteen forty eight she told john pic and robert oswald
that she could not afford to send them back to the military school and she asked pic to quit school entirely to help support the family
which he did for four months in the fall of nineteen forty eight
in order to supplement their income further she falsely swore that pic was seventeen years old so that he could join the marine corps reserves
pic did turn over part of his income to his mother
but he returned to high school in january of nineteen forty nine where he stayed until three days before he was scheduled to graduate
when he left school in order to get into the coast guard since his mother did not approve of his decision to continue school
he accepted the responsibility for that decision himself and signed his mother's name to all his own excuses and report cards
pic thought that his mother overstated her financial problems and was unduly concerned about money
referring to the period after the divorce from ekdahl which was apparently caused in part by marguerite's desire to get more money from him
pic said quote
lee was brought up in this atmosphere of constant money problems and i am sure it had quite an effect on him and also robert end quote
marguerite oswald worked in miscellaneous jobs after her divorce from ekdahl
when she worked for a time as an insurance saleslady
she would sometimes take lee with her apparently leaving him alone in the car while she transacted her business
when she worked during the school year lee had to leave an empty house in the morning
return to it for lunch and then again at night his mother having trained him to do that rather than to play with other children
an indication of the nature of lee's character at this time was provided in the spring of nineteen fifty
when he was sent to new orleans to visit the family of his mother's sister misess lillian murret for two or three weeks
despite their urgings he refused to play with the other children his own age
it also appears that lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
but apparently was not able to spend as much time with them as he would have liked because of the age gaps of five and seven years
which became more significant as the children grew older
whatever problems may have been created by lee's home life in louisiana and texas
he apparently adjusted well enough there to have had an average although gradually deteriorating school record
with no behavior or truancy problems
that was not the case however after he and his mother moved to new york in august of nineteen fifty two shortly before lee's thirteenth birthday
they moved shortly after robert joined the marines they lived for a time with john pic who was stationed there with the coast guard
relations soon became strained however so in late september lee and his mother moved to their own apartment in the bronx
pic and his wife would have been happy to have kept lee however
who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother having struck her on at least one occasion
the short lived stay with the pics was terminated after an incident in which lee allegedly pulled out a pocket knife during an argument
and threatened to use it on misess pic
when pic returned home misess oswald tried to play down the event but misess pic took a different view and asked the oswalds to leave
lee refused to discuss the matter with pic whom he had previously idolized and their relations were strained thereafter
on september thirty nineteen fifty two lee enrolled in p s one seventeen
a junior high school in the bronx where the other children apparently teased him because of his quote western clothes and texas accent
he began to stay away from school preferring to read magazines and watch television at home by himself
this continued despite the efforts of the school authorities and to a lesser extent of his mother to have him return to school
truancy charges were brought against him alleging that he was quote beyond the control of his mother insofar as school attendance is concerned end quote
oswald was remanded for psychiatric observation to youth house an institution in which children are kept for psychiatric observation
or for detention pending court appearance or commitment to a child caring or custodial institution such as a training school
he was in youth house from april sixteen to may seven nineteen fifty three
during which time he was examined by its chief psychiatrist doctor renatus hartogs
and interviewed and observed by other members of the youth house staff
marguerite oswald visited her son at youth house where she recalled that she waited in line quote
with puerto ricans and negroes and everything end quote
she said that her pocketbook was searched quote because the children in this home were such criminals dope fiends and had been in criminal offenses
that anybody entering this home had to be searched in case the parents were bringing cigarettes or narcotics or anything end quote
she recalled that lee cried and said quote mother i want to get out of here
there are children in here who have killed people and smoke i want to get out end quote
marguerite oswald said that she had not realized until then in what kind of place her son had been confined
on the other hand lee told his probation officer john carro that quote
while he liked youth house he missed the freedom of doing what he wanted he indicated that he did not miss his mother end quote
misess evelyn d siegel a social worker who interviewed both lee and his mother while lee was confined in youth house
reported that lee quote confided that the worse thing about youth house was the fact that he had to be with other boys all the time
was disturbed about disrobing in front of them taking showers with them etc end quote
contrary to reports that appeared after the assassination the psychiatric examination did not indicate that lee oswald was a potential assassin
potentially dangerous that quote his outlook on life had strongly paranoid overtones end quote or that he should be institutionalized
doctor hartogs did find oswald to be a tense withdrawn and evasive boy who intensely disliked talking about himself and his feelings
he noted that lee liked to give the impression that he did not care for other people but preferred to keep to himself
so that he was not bothered and did not have to make the effort of communicating
oswald's withdrawn tendencies and solitary habits were thought to be the result of quote
intense anxiety shyness feelings of awkwardness and insecurity end quote
he was reported to have said quote i don't want a friend and i don't like to talk to people end quote and quote i dislike everybody end quote
he was also described as having a quote vivid fantasy life
turning around the topics of omnipotence and power through which he tries to compensate for his present shortcomings and frustrations end quote
doctor hartogs summarized his report by stating
quote this thirteen year old well built boy has superior mental resources and functions only slightly below his capacity level
in spite of chronic truancy from school which brought him into youth house
no finding of neurological impairment or psychotic mental changes could be made
lee has to be diagnosed as quote personality pattern disturbance with schizoid features and passive aggressive tendencies end quote
lee has to be seen as an emotionally quite disturbed youngster
who suffers under the impact of really existing emotional isolation
and deprivation lack of affection absence of family life and rejection by a self involved and conflicted mother
doctor hartogs recommended that oswald be placed on probation on condition that he seek help and guidance through a child guidance clinic
there he suggested lee should be treated by a male psychiatrist who could substitute for the lack of a father figure
he also recommended that misess oswald seek quote psychotherapeutic guidance through contact with a family agency end quote
the possibility of commitment was to be considered only if the probation plan was not successful
lee's withdrawal was also noted by misess siegel who described him as a quote seriously detached withdrawn youngster end quote
she also noted that there was quote a rather pleasant appealing quality about this emotionally starved affectionless youngster
which grows as one speaks to him end quote
she thought that he had detached himself from the world around him because quote no one in it ever met any of his needs for love end quote
she observed that since lee's mother worked all day he made his own meals and spent all his time alone
because he didn't make friends with the boys in the neighborhood she thought that he quote withdrew into a completely solitary and detached existence
where he did as he wanted and he didn't have to live by any rules or come into contact with people end quote
misess siegel concluded that lee quote just felt that his mother never gave a damn for him
he always felt like a burden that she simply just had to tolerate end quote
lee confirmed some of those observations by saying that he felt almost as if there were a veil between him and other people
through which they could not reach him but that he preferred the veil to remain intact
he admitted to fantasies about being powerful and sometimes hurting and killing people but refused to elaborate on them
he took the position that such matters were his own business
a psychological human figure drawing test corroborated the interviewer's findings that lee was insecure and had limited social contacts
irving sokolow a youth house psychologist reported that quote
the human figure drawings are empty poor characterizations of persons approximately the same age as the subject
they reflect a considerable amount of impoverishment in the social and emotional areas
he appears to be a somewhat insecure youngster exhibiting much inclination for warm and satisfying relationships to others
there is some indication that he may relate to men more easily than to women in view of the more mature conceptualisation
he appears slightly withdrawn and in view of the lack of detail within the drawings this may assume a more significant characteristic
he exhibits some difficulty in relationship to the maternal figure suggesting more anxiety in this area than in any other
lee scored an i q of one eighteen on the wechsler intelligence scale for children
according to sokolow this indicated a quote present intellectual functioning in the upper range of bright normal intelligence end quote
sokolow said that although lee was quote presumably disinterested in school subjects he operates on a much higher than average level end quote
on the monroe silent reading test lee's score indicated no retardation in reading speed and comprehension
he had better than average ability in arithmetical reasoning for his age group
lee told carro his probation officer that he liked to be by himself because he had too much difficulty in making friends
the reports of carro and misess siegel also indicate an ambivalent attitude toward authority on oswald's part
carro reported that lee was disruptive in class after he returned to school on a regular basis in the fall of nineteen fifty three
he had refused to salute the flag and was doing very little if any work
it appears that he did not want to do any of the things which the authorities suggested in their efforts to bring him out of the shell
into which he appeared to be retreating
he told misess siegel that he would run away if sent to a boarding school
on the other hand he also told her that he wished his mother had been more firm with him in her attempts to get him to return to school
the reports of the new york authorities indicate that lee's mother gave him very little affection and did not serve as any sort of substitute for a father
furthermore she did not appear to understand her own relationship to lee's psychological problems
after her interview with misess oswald
misess siegel described her as a smartly dressed gray haired woman very self possessed and alert and superficially affable
but essentially a quote defensive rigid self involved person
who had real difficulty in accepting and relating to people end quote and who had quote little understanding end quote of lee's behavior
and of the quote protective shell he has drawn around himself end quote doctor hartogs reported that misess oswald did not understand
that lee's withdrawal was a form of quote violent but silent protest against his neglect by her
and represents his reaction to a complete absence of any real family life end quote
carro reported that when questioned about his mother lee said quote
well i've got to live with her i guess i love her end quote
it may also be significant that as reported by john pic quote lee slept with my mother until i joined the service in nineteen fifty
this would make him approximately ten well almost eleven years old end quote
the factors in lee oswald's personality which were noted by those who had contact with him in new york indicate
that he had great difficulty in adapting himself to conditions in that city
his usual reaction to the problems which he encountered there was simply withdrawal
those factors indicated a severe inability to enter into relationships with other people
in view of his experiences when he visited his relatives in new orleans in the spring of nineteen fifty and his other solitary habits
lee had apparently been experiencing similar problems before going to new york
and as will be shown below this failure to adapt to his environment was a dominant trait in his later life
it would be incorrect however to believe that those aspects of lee's personality which were observed in new york
could have led anyone to predict the outburst of violence which finally occurred
carro was the only one of oswald's three principal observers who recommended that he be placed in a boy's home or similar institution
but carro was quite specific that his recommendation was based primarily on the adverse factors in lee's environment
his lack of friends the apparent unavailability of any agency assistance and the ineffectualness of his mother
and not on any particular mental disturbance in the boy himself
carro testified that quote there was nothing that would lead me to believe when i saw him at the age of twelve that them would be seeds of destruction for somebody
i couldn't in all honesty sincerely say such a thing
misess siegel concluded her report with the statement that quote
despite his withdrawal he gives the impression that he is not so difficult to reach as he appears and patient prolonged effort
in a sustained relationship with one therapist might bring results
there are indications that he has suffered serious personality damage but if he can receive help quickly this might be repaired to some extent end quote
lee oswald never received that help
few social agencies even in new york were equipped to provide the kind of intensive treatment that he needed
and when one of the city's clinics did find room to handle him
for some reason the record does not show advantage was never taken of the chance afforded to oswald
when lee became a disciplinary problem upon his return to school in the fall of nineteen fifty three
and when his mother failed to cooperate in any way with school authorities
authorities were finally forced to consider placement in a home for boys
such a placement was postponed however perhaps in part at least because lee's behavior suddenly improved
before the court took any action the oswalds left new york in january of nineteen fifty four
and returned to new orleans where lee finished the ninth grade before he left school to work for a year

chapter seven lee harvey oswald background and possible motives part two
return to new orleans and joining the marine corps
after his return to new orleans oswald was teased at school because of the northern accent which he had acquired
he concluded that school had nothing to offer him
his mother exercised little control over him and thought he could decide for himself whether to go on in school
neighbors and others who knew him at that time recall an introverted boy who read a great deal
he took walks and visited museums and sometimes rode a rented bicycle in the park on saturday mornings
misess murret believes that he talked at length with a girl on the telephone but no one remembers that he had any dates
a friend edward voebel testified that quote he was more bashful about girls than anything else end quote
several witnesses testified that lee oswald was not aggressive he was however involved in some fights
once a group of white boys beat him up for sitting in the negro section of a bus which he apparently did simply out of ignorance
another time he fought with two brothers who claimed that he had picked on the younger of them three years oswald's junior
two days later quote some big guy probably from a high school he looked like a tremendous football player end quote
accosted oswald on the way home from school and punched him in the mouth making his lip bleed and loosening a tooth
voebel took oswald back to the school to attend to his wounds and their quote mild friendship end quote stemmed from that incident
voebel also recalled that oswald once outlined a plan to cut the glass in the window of a store on rampart street and steal a pistol
but he was not sure then that oswald meant to carry out the plan and in fact they never did
voebel said that oswald quote wouldn't start any fights but if you wanted to start one with him he was going to make sure that he ended it
or you were going to really have one because he wasn't going to take anything from anybody end quote
in a space for the names of quote close friends end quote on the ninth grade personal history record
oswald first wrote quote edward vogel end quote an obvious misspelling of voebel's name
and quote arthor abear end quote most likely arthur hebert a classmate who has said that he did not know oswald well
oswald erased those names however and indicated that he had no close friends
it has been suggested that this misspelling of names apparently on a phonetic basis was caused by a reading spelling disability
from which oswald appeared to suffer
other evidence of the existence of such a disability is provided by the many other misspellings that appear in oswald's writings portions of which are quoted below
sometime during this period and under circumstances to be discussed more fully below
oswald started to read communist literature which he obtained from the public library
one of his fellow employees palmer mcbride stated that oswald said he would like to kill president eisenhower because he was exploiting the working class
oswald praised khrushchev and suggested that he and mcbride join the communist party quote to take advantage of their social functions end quote
oswald also became interested in the new orleans amateur astronomy association an organization of high school students
the association's then president william e wulf testified that he remembered an occasion when oswald quote
started expounding the communist doctrine and saying that he was highly interested in communism that communism was the only way of life for the worker et cetera
and then came out with a statement that he was looking for a communist cell in town to join but he couldn't find any
he was a little dismayed at this and he said that he couldn't find any that would show any interest in him as a communist
and subsequently after this conversation my father came in and we were kind of arguing back and forth about the situation and my father came in the room
heard what we were arguing on communism and that this boy was loud mouthed boisterous and my father asked him to leave the house and politely put him out of the house
and that is the last i have seen or spoken with oswald end quote
despite this apparent interest in communism oswald tried to join the marines when he was sixteen years old
this was one year before his actual enlistment and just a little over two point five years after he left new york
he wrote a note in his mother's name to school authorities in new orleans saying that he was leaving school because he and his mother were moving to san diego
in fact he had quit school in an attempt to obtain his mother's assistance to join the marines
while he apparently was able to induce his mother to make a false statement about his age
he was nevertheless unable to convince the proper authorities that he was really seventeen years old
there is evidence that oswald was greatly influenced in his decision to join the marines by the fact that his brother robert had done so
approximately three years before robert oswald had given his marine corps manual to his brother lee
who studied it during the year following his unsuccessful attempt to enlist until quote he knew it by heart end quote
according to marguerite oswald quote lee lived for the time that he would become seventeen years old to join the marines that whole year end quote
in john pic's view
oswald was motivated to join the marines in large part by a desire quote to get from out and under the yoke of oppression from my mother end quote
oswald's inability or lack of desire to enter into meaningful relationships with other people
continued during this period in new orleans nineteen fifty four to nineteen fifty six
it probably contributed greatly to the general dissatisfaction which he exhibited with his environment
a dissatisfaction which seemed to find expression at this particular point
in his intense desire to join the marines and get away from his surroundings and his mother
his study of communist literature
which might appear to be inconsistent with his desire to join the marines could have been another manifestation of oswald's rejection of his environment
his difficulty in relating to other people and his general dissatisfaction with the world around him continued while he was in the marine corps
kerry thornley a marine associate
who shortly after oswald's defection wrote an as yet unpublished novel based in considerable part on oswald's life
testified that quote definitely the marine corps was not what he had expected it to be when he joined end quote
he said that oswald quote seemed to guard against developing real close friendships end quote
daniel powers another marine who was stationed with oswald for part of his marine career
testified that oswald seemed quote always to be striving for a relationship but whenever he did
his general personality would alienate the group against him end quote
other marines also testified that oswald had few friends and kept very much to himself
while there is nothing in oswald's military records to indicate that he was mentally unstable or otherwise psychologically unfit for duty in the marine corps
he did not adjust well to conditions which he found in that service
he did not rise above the rank of private first class even though he had passed a qualifying examination for the rank of corporal
his marine career was not helped by his attitude
that he was a man of great ability and intelligence and that many of his superiors in the marine corps were not sufficiently competent to give him orders
while oswald did not seem to object to authority in the abstract he did think that he should be the one to exercise it
john e donovan one of his former officers testified that oswald thought quote
that authority particularly the marine corps ought to be able to recognize talent such as his own without a given magic college degree
and put them in positions of prominence end quote oswald manifested this feeling about authority by baiting his officers
he led them into discussions of foreign affairs about which they often knew less than he did since he had apparently devoted considerable time to a study of such matters
when the officers were unable to discuss foreign affairs satisfactorily with him oswald regarded them as unfit to exercise command over him
nelson delgado one of oswald's fellow marines testified that oswald tried to quote cut up anybody that was high ranking end quote
in those arguments quote and make himself come out top dog end quote
oswald probably engaged his superiors in arguments on a subject that he had studied
in an attempt to attract attention to himself and to support his exaggerated idea of his own abilities
thornley also testified that he thought that oswald's extreme personal sloppiness in the marine corps quote
fitted into a general personality pattern of his to do whatever was not wanted of him a recalcitrant trend in his personality end quote
oswald quote seemed to be a person who would go out of his way to get into trouble end quote
and then used the quote special treatment end quote he received as an example of the way in which he was being picked on and quote
as a means of getting or attempting to get sympathy end quote in thornley's view oswald labored under a persecution complex
which he strove to maintain and quote felt the marine corps kept a pretty close watch on him because of his subversive activities end quote
thornley added quote i think it was kind of necessary to him to believe that he was being picked on
it wasn't anything extreme i wouldn't go as far as to call it call him a paranoid but a definite tendency there was in that direction i think end quote
powers considered oswald to be meek and easily led
an quote individual that you would brainwash and quite easy but i think once he believed in something he stood in his beliefs end quote
powers also testified that oswald was reserved and seemed to be quote somewhat the frail little puppy in the litter end quote
he had the nickname quote ozzie rabbit end quote
oswald read a good deal said powers but quote he would never be reading any of the shoot em up westerns or anything like that
normally it would be a good type of literature and the one that i recall was leaves of grass by walt whitman end quote
according to powers oswald said quote
all the marine corps did was to teach you to kill and after you got out of the marines you might be good gangsters end quote
powers believed that when oswald arrived in japan he acquired a girlfriend quote
finally attaining a male status or image in his own eyes end quote that apparently caused oswald to become more self confident
aggressive and even somewhat pugnacious although powers quote wouldn't say that this guy is a troublemaker end quote
powers said quote now he was oswald the man rather than oswald the rabbit end quote
oswald once told powers that he didn't care if he returned to the united states at all
while in japan oswald's new found apparent self confidence and pugnaciousness
led to an incident in which he spilled a drink on one of his sergeants and abusively challenged him to fight
at the court martial hearing which followed oswald admitted that he had been rather drunk when the incident occurred
he testified that he had felt the sergeant had a grudge against him and that he had unsuccessfully sought a transfer from the sergeant's unit
he said that he had simply wanted to discuss the question with the sergeant and the drink had been spilled accidentally
the hearing officer agreed with the latter claim but found oswald guilty of wrongfully using provoking words and sentenced him to twenty eight days
canceling the suspension of a twenty day sentence that oswald had received in an earlier court martial
for possessing an unauthorized pistol with which he had accidentally shot himself
at his own request
oswald was transferred from active duty to the marine corps reserve under honorable conditions in september of nineteen fifty nine
three months prior to his regularly scheduled separation date ostensibly to care for his mother who had been injured in an accident at her work
he was undesirably discharged from the marine corps reserve to which he had been assigned on inactive status following his transfer from active duty
after it was learned that he had defected to the soviet union
in an attempt to have this discharge reversed
oswald wrote to then secretary of the navy connally on january thirty nineteen sixty two
stating that he would quote employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice end quote
governor connally had just resigned to run for governor of texas so he advised oswald that he had forwarded the letter to his successor
it is thus clear that oswald knew that governor connally was never directly concerned with his discharge
and he must have known that president kennedy had had nothing to do with it
in that connection it does not appear that oswald ever expressed any dissatisfaction of any kind with either the president or governor connally
marina oswald testified that she quote had never heard anything bad about kennedy from lee and he never had anything against him end quote
misess oswald said that her husband did not say anything about governor connally after his return to the united states she testified quote
but while we were in russia he spoke well of him lee said that when he would return to the united states he would vote for him for governor end quote
oswald must have already learned that the governor could not help him with his discharge because he was no longer secretary of the navy at the time he made that remark
even though oswald apparently did not express any hostility against the president or governor connally
he continued to be concerned about his undesirable discharge it is clear that he thought he had been unjustly treated
probably his complaint was due to the fact that his discharge was not related to anything he had done while on active duty
and also because he had not received any notice of the original discharge proceedings since his whereabouts were not known
he continued his efforts to reverse the discharge by petitioning the navy discharge review board
which finally declined to modify the discharge and so advised him in a letter dated july nineteen sixty three
governor connally's connection with the discharge although indirect caused the commission to consider whether he might have been oswald's real target
in that connection it should be noted that marina oswald testified on september six nineteen sixty four that she thought her husband quote
was shooting at connally rather than president kennedy end quote
in support of her conclusion misess oswald noted her husband's undesirable discharge
and that she could not think of any reason why oswald would want to kill president kennedy
it should be noted however that at the time oswald fired the shots at the presidential limousine the governor occupied the seat in front of the president
and it would have been almost impossible for oswald to have hit the governor without hitting the president first
oswald could have shot the governor as the car approached the depository or as it was making the turn onto elm street
once it had started down elm street toward the triple underpass however
the president almost completely blocked oswald's view of the governor prior to the time the first shot struck the president
oswald would have had other and more favorable opportunities to strike at the governor than on this occasion when as a member of the president's party
he had more protection than usual it would appear therefore that to the extent oswald's undesirable discharge affected his motivation
it was more in terms of a general hostility against the government and its representatives rather than a grudge against any particular person
interest in marxism
as indicated above oswald started to read communist literature after he and his mother left new york and moved to new orleans
he told aline mosby a reporter who interviewed him after he arrived in moscow quote
i'm a marxist i became interested about the age of fifteen from an ideological viewpoint
an old lady handed me a pamphlet about saving the rosenbergs i looked at that paper and i still remember it for some reason i don't know why end quote
oswald studied marxism after he joined the marines and his sympathies in that direction and for the soviet union appear to have been widely known
at least in the unit to which he was assigned after his return from the far east
his interest in russia led some of his associates to call him comrade or oswaldskovitch
he always wanted to play the red pieces in chess because as he said in an apparently humorous context
he preferred the quote red army end quote
he studied the russian language read a russian language newspaper and seemed interested in what was going on in the soviet union
thornley who thought oswald had an irrevocable conviction that his marxist beliefs were correct testified quote
i think you could sit down and argue with him for a number of years and i don't think you could have changed his mind on that unless you knew why he believed it in the first place
i certainly don't i don't think with any kind of formal argument you could have shaken that conviction and that is why i say irrevocable
it was just never getting back to looking at things from any other way once he had become a marxist whenever that was end quote
thornley also testified about an incident which grew
out of a combination of oswald's known marxist sympathies and george orwell's book nineteen eighty four one of oswald's favorite books
which thornley read at oswald's suggestion
shortly after thornley finished reading that book the marine unit to which both men were assigned was required to take part in a saturday morning parade
in honor of some retiring noncommissioned officers an event which they both approached with little enthusiasm
while waiting for the parade to start they talked briefly about nineteen eighty four
even though oswald seemed to be lost in his own thoughts after a brief period of silence oswald remarked on the stupidity of the parade
and on how angry it made him to which thornley replied quote well comes the revolution you will change all that end quote
thornley testified quote at which time he looked at me like a betrayed caesar and screamed screamed definitely not you too thornley
and i remember his voice cracked as he said this he was definitely disturbed at what i had said and i didn't really think i had said that much
i never said anything to him again and he never said anything to me again end quote
thornley said that he had made his remark only in the context of nineteen eighty four
and had not intended any criticism of oswald's political views which is the way in which thornley thought oswald took his remarks
lieutenant donovan testified that oswald thought that quote there were many grave injustices concerning the affairs in the international situation end quote
he recalled that oswald had a specific interest in latin america particularly cuba
and expressed opposition to the batista regime and sympathy for castro an attitude which donovan said was quote
not unpopular end quote at that time donovan testified
that he never heard oswald express a desire personally to take part in the elimination of injustices anywhere in the world and that he quote
never heard him in any way shape or form confess that he was a communist or that he ever thought about being a communist end quote
delgado testified that oswald was quote a complete believer that our way of government was not quite right end quote
and believed that our government did not have quote too much to offer end quote but was not in favor of quote the communist way of life end quote
delgado and oswald talked more about cuba than russia and sometimes imagined themselves as leaders in the cuban army or government
who might quote lead an expedition to some of these other islands and free them too end quote
thornley also believed that oswald's marxist beliefs led to an extraordinary view of history under which quote he looked upon the eyes of future people
as some kind of tribunal
and he wanted to be on the winning side so that ten thousand years from now people would look in the history books and say well this man was ahead of his time
the eyes of the future became the eyes of god
he was concerned with his image in history and i do think that is why he chose the particular method of defecting he chose and did it in the way he did
it got him in the newspapers it did broadcast his name out end quote
thornley thought that oswald not only wanted a place in history but also wanted to live comfortably in the present
he testified that if oswald could not have that quote degree of physical comfort that he expected or sought
i think he would then throw himself entirely on the other thing he also wanted which was the image in history
i think he wanted both if he could have them if he didn't he wanted to die with the knowledge that or with the idea that he was somebody end quote
oswald's interest in marxism led some people to avoid him
even though as his wife suggested that interest may have been motivated by a desire to gain attention he used his marxist and associated activities
as excuses for his difficulties in getting along in the world which were usually caused by entirely different factors
his use of those excuses to present himself to the world as a person who was being unfairly treated
is shown most clearly by his employment relations after his return from the soviet union of course he made his real problems worse to the extent
that his use of those excuses prevented him from discovering the real reasons for and attempting to overcome his difficulties
of greater importance
oswald's commitment to marxism contributed to the decisions which led him to defect to the soviet union in nineteen fifty nine and later
to engage in activities on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee in the summer of nineteen sixty three

background and possible motives part three
defection to the soviet union
after oswald left the marine corps in september of nineteen fifty nine ostensibly to care for his mother
he almost immediately left for the soviet union where he attempted to renounce his citizenship
at the age of nineteen oswald thus committed an act which was the most striking indication he had yet given
of his willingness to act on his beliefs in quite extraordinary ways
while his defection resulted in part from oswald's commitment to marxism
it appears that personal and psychological factors were also involved
on august seventeen nineteen sixty three oswald told mister william stuckey
who had arranged a radio debate on oswald's activities on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee
that while he had begun to read marx and engels at the age of fifteen the conclusive thing that made him decide that marxism was the answer
was his service in japan
he said living conditions over there convinced him something was wrong with the system and that possibly marxism was the answer
he said it was in japan that he made up his mind to go to russia
and see for himself how a revolutionary society operates a marxist society
on the other hand at least one person who knew oswald after his return thought that his defection had a more personal and psychological basis
the validity of the latter observation is borne out by some of the things oswald wrote in connection with his defection
indicating that his motivation was at least in part a personal one on november twenty six nineteen fifty nine
shortly after he arrived in the soviet union and probably before soviet authorities had given him permission to stay indefinitely
he wrote to his brother robert that the soviet union was a country which quote i have always considered to be my own end quote
and that he went there quote only to find freedom i could never have been personally happy in the u s end quote
he wrote in another letter that he would quote never return to the united states which is a country i hate end quote
his idea that he was to find quote freedom end quote in the soviet union was to be rudely shattered
whatever oswald's reasons for going to the soviet union might have been however there can be little doubt that his desire to go was quite strong
in addition to studying the russian language while he was in the marines
oswald had managed to save enough money to cover the expenses of his forthcoming trip
while there is no proof that he saved fifteen hundred dollars as he claimed
it would have taken considerable discipline to save whatever amount was required to finance his defection out of the salary of a low ranking enlisted man
the extent of oswald's desire to go to the soviet union
and of his initial commitment to that country can best be understood however in the context
of his concomitant hatred of the united states which was most clearly expressed in his november twenty six
and communist's would like to see the present capitalist government of the u s overthrown end quote oswald stated
that that government supported an economic system quote which exploits all its workers end quote
and under which quote art culture and the sprit of man are subjected to commercial enterprising
and religion and education are used as a tool to suppress what would otherwise be a population questioning their government's unfair
economic system and plans for war end quote
he complained in his letter about segregation
unemployment automation and the use of military forces to suppress other populations
asking his brother why he supported the american government and what ideals he put forward oswald wrote quote
ask me and i will tell you i fight for communism
i will not say your grandchildren will live under communism look for yourself at history look at a world map america is a dicing country
i do not wish to be a part of it nor do i ever again wish to be used as a tool in its military aggressions
this should answer your question and also give you a glimpse of my way of thinking so you speak of advantages do you think that is why i am here
for personal material advantages happiness is not based on oneself it does not consist of a small home of taking and getting
happiness is taking part in the struggle where there is no borderline between one's own personal world and the world in general
i never believed i would find more material advantages at this stage of development in the soviet union than i might of had in the u s
i have been a pro communist for years and yet i have never met a communist instead i kept silent and observed
and what i observed plus my marxist learning brought me here to the soviet union
i have always considered this country to be my own end quote
responding to robert's statement that he had not renounced him
oswald told his brother quote on what terms i want this arrangement end quote he advised robert that one
in the event of war i would kill any american who put a uniform on in defense of the american government any american
two that in my own mind i have no attachments of any kind in the u s
three that i want to and i shall live a normal happy and peaceful life here in the soviet union for the rest of my life
that my mother and you are in spite of what the newspaper said not objects of affection but only examples of workers in the u s
despite this commitment to the soviet union
oswald met disappointments there just as he had in the past at the outset the soviets told him that he could not remain
it seems that oswald immediately attempted suicide a striking indication of how much he desired to remain in the soviet union
it shows how willing he was to act dramatically and decisively when he faced an emotional crisis
with few readily available alternatives at hand he was shocked to find that the soviet union did not accept him with open arms
the entry in his self styled quote historic diary end quote for october twenty one nineteen fifty nine reports quote
i am shocked my dreams i have waited for two years to be accepted
my fondest dreams are shattered because of a petty official i decide to end it
soak fist in cold water to numb the pain then slash my left wrist than plunge wrist into bathtub of hot water
somewhere a violin plays as i watch my life whirl away
i think to myself how easy to die and a sweet death to violins end quote
oswald was discovered in time to thwart his attempt at suicide
he was taken to a hospital in moscow where he was kept until october twenty eight nineteen fifty nine
still intent however on staying in the soviet union
oswald went on october thirty one to the american embassy to renounce his u s citizenship
mister richard e snyder then second secretary and senior consular official at the embassy
testified that oswald was extremely sure of himself and seemed quote to know what his mission was
he took charge in a sense of the conversation right from the beginning end quote he presented the following signed note
quote i lee harvey oswald do hereby request that my present citizenship in the united states of america be revoked
i have entered the soviet union for the express purpose of applying for citizenship in the soviet union through the means of naturalization
my request for citizenship is now pending before the supreme soviet of the u s s r i take these steps for political reasons
my request for the revoking of my american citizenship
is made only after the longest and most serious considerations i affirm that my allegiance is to the union of soviet socialist republics
end quote as his quote principal reason end quote for renouncing his citizenship
oswald stated quote i am a marxist end quote he also alluded to hardships endured by his mother as a worker
referring to them as experiences that he did not intend to have himself even though he stated that he had never held a civilian job
he said that his marine service in okinawa and elsewhere had given him quote a chance to observe american imperialism end quote
but he also displayed some sensitivity at not having reached a higher rank in the marine corps
he stated that he had volunteered to give soviet officials any information that he had concerning marine corps operations and intimated
that he might know something of special interest oswald's historic diary describes the event in part as follows quote
i leave embassy elated at this showdown returning to my hotel i feel now my energies are not spent in vain
i'm sure russians will accept me after this sign of my faith in them end quote
the soviet authorities finally permitted oswald to remain in their country
no evidence has been found that they used him for any particular propaganda or other political or informational purposes
they sent him to minsk to work in a radio and television factory as a metal worker
the soviet authorities denied oswald permission
to attend a university in moscow but they gave him a monthly allowance of seven hundred rubles a month
old exchange rate in addition to his factory salary of approximately equal amount
and considerably better living quarters than those accorded to soviet citizens of equal age and station
the subsidy apparently similar to those sometimes given to foreigners allowed to remain in the soviet union together with his salary
gave oswald an income which he said approximated that of the director of the factory in which he worked
even though he received more money and better living quarters than other russians doing similar work
he envied his wife's uncle a colonel in the mvd because of the larger apartment in which he lived
reminiscent of his attitude toward his superiors in the marine corps
oswald apparently resented the exercise of authority over him and the better treatment afforded to communist party officials
after he returned to the united states
he took the position that the communist party officials in the soviet union were opportunists who were betraying their positions for personal gain
he is reported to have expressed the conclusion that they had quote fat stinking politicians over there just like we have over here end quote
oswald apparently continued to have personal difficulties while he was in minsk
although marina oswald told the commission that her husband had good personal relationships in the soviet union katherine ford
one of the members of the russian community in dallas with which the oswalds became acquainted upon their arrival in the united states
stated that misess oswald told her everybody in russia quote hated him end quote
jeanne de mohrenschildt another member of that group
said that oswald told her that he had returned because quote i didn't find what i was looking for end quote
george de mohrenschildt thought that oswald must have become disgusted with life in the soviet union as the novelty
of the presence of an american wore off and he began to be less the center of attention
the best description of oswald's state of mind however is set forth in his own historic diary
under the entry for may one nineteen sixty
he noted that one of his acquaintances quote relates many things i do not know about the u s s r
i begin to feel uneasy inside its true end quote
under the entry for august to september of that year he wrote quote
as my russian improves i become increasingly conscious of just what sort of a society i live in
mass gymnastics compulsory afterwork meeting usually political information meeting
compulsory attendance at lectures and the sending of the entire shop collective except me to pick potatoes on a sunday at a state collective farm
a patriotic duty to bring in the harvest the opinions of the workers unvoiced are that it's a great pain in the neck
they don't seem to be especially enthusiastic about any of the collective duties a natural feeling
i am increasingly aware of the presence in all thing of lebizen shop party secretary fat fortyish and jovial on the outside
he is a no nonsense party regular
finally the entry of january four to thirty one of nineteen sixty one quote
i am stating to reconsider my desire about staying the work is drab the money i get has nowhere to be spent
no night clubs or bowling alleys no places of recreation except the trade union dances i have had enough
shortly thereafter less than eighteen months after his defection about six weeks before he met marina prusakova
oswald opened negotiations with the u s embassy in moscow looking toward his return to the united states
return to the united states in view of the intensity of his earlier commitment to the soviet union
a great change must have occurred in oswald's thinking to induce him to return to the united states
the psychological effects of that change must have been highly unsettling it should be remembered
that he was not yet twenty years old when he went to the soviet union with such high hopes and not quite twenty three when he returned bitterly disappointed
his attempt to renounce his citizenship had been an open expression of hostility against the united states and a profound rejection of his early life
the dramatic break with society in america now had to be undone
his return to the united states publicly testified to the utter failure of what had been the most important act of his life
marina oswald confirmed the fact that her husband was experiencing psychological difficulties at the time of his return
she said that quote immediately after coming to the united states lee changed i did not know him as such a man in russia end quote
she added that while he helped her as he had done before he became more of a recluse that quote
he was very irritable sometimes for a trifle end quote and that quote lee was very unrestrained and very explosive end quote
during the period from november nineteen nineteen sixty two to march of nineteen sixty three
after the assassination she wrote that quote
in general our family life began to deteriorate after we arrived in america
lee was always hot tempered and now this trait of character more and more prevented us from living together in harmony
lee became very irritable and sometimes some completely trivial thing would drive him into a rage
i myself do not have a particularly quiet disposition
but i had to change my character a great deal in order to maintain a more or less peaceful family life end quote
marina oswald's judgment of her husband's state of mind may be substantiated by comparing material which he wrote in the soviet union
with what he wrote while on the way back to the united states and after his return
while in the soviet union he wrote his longest and clearest piece of work the collective
this was a fairly coherent description of life in that country basically centered around the radio and television factory in which he worked
while it was apparently intended for publication in the united states and is in many respects critical of certain aspects of life in the soviet union
it appears to be the work of a fairly well organized person
oswald prefaced his manuscript with a short autobiographical sketch which reads in part as follows quote
lee harvey oswald was born in october nineteen thirty nine in new orleans louisiana the son of a insurance salesmen whose early death
left a far mean streak of independence brought on by neglect
entering the us marine corp at seventeen this streak of independence was strengthened by exotic journeys to japan
the philippines and the scores of odd islands in the pacific
immediately after serving out his three years in the u s marine corps he abandoned his american life to seek a new life in the ussr
full of optimism and hope he stood in red square in the fall of nineteen fifty nine vowing to see his chosen course through
after however two years and a lot of growing up i decided to return to the usa
the collective contrasts sharply with material which oswald seems to have written after he left the soviet union
which appears to be more an expression of his own psychological condition than of a reasoned analysis
the latter material expresses great hostility to both communism and capitalism he wrote that to a person knowing both of those systems quote
there can be no mediation between those systems as they exist today and that person
he must be opposed to their basic foundations and representatives end quote
and yet it is immature to take the sort of attitude which says quote a curse on both your houses end quote
there are two great representatives of power in the world
simply expressed the left and right and their offspring factions and concerns any practical attempt at one alternative
must have as its nucleus the traditional ideological best of both systems and yet be utterly opposed to both systems
such an alternative was to be opposed both to capitalism and communism because quote
no man having known having lived under the russian communist and american capitalist system
could possibly make a choice between them there is no choice
one offers oppression the other poverty both offer imperialistic injustice tinted with two brands of slavery end quote
oswald actually did attempt to formulate such an alternative which he planned to quote put forward end quote himself
he thought the new alternative would have its best chance to be accepted after quote conflict between the two world systems leaves the world country
without defense or foundation of government end quote
after which the survivors would quote seek an alternative opposed to those systems which have brought them misery end quote
oswald realized that quote their thinking and education will be steeped in the traditions of those systems
and they would never accept a new order complete beyond their understanding end quote
as a result he thought it would be quote necessary to oppose the old systems but at the same time support their cherished traditions end quote
expanding on his ideas on how his alternative to communism and capitalism might be introduced he wrote of a quote readily foreseeable
economic political or military crisis internal or external
which will bring about the final destruction of the capitalist system and indicated that
preparation in a special party could safeguard an independent course of action after the debacle end quote
which would achieve the goal which was quote the emplacement of a separate democratic pure communist society
but one with union communes
democratic socializing of production and without regard to the twisting apart of marxism marxist communism by other powers
while quote resourcefulness and patient working towards the aforesaid goals
are preferred rather than loud and useless manifestations of protest end quote oswald went on to note quote
but these preferred tactics now may prove to be too limited in the near future
they should not be confused with slowness indecision or fear only the intellectually fearless could even be remotely attracted to our doctrine
and yet this doctrine requires the utmost utmost restraint a state of being in itself majestic in power end quote
oswald's decided rejection of both capitalism and communism
seemed to place him in a situation in which he could not live with satisfaction either in the united states or in the soviet union
the discussion above has already set forth examples of his expression of hatred for the united states
he also expressed hatred of the soviet union and of the communist party u s a
even though he later referred to the latter as quote trusted long time fighters for progress end quote
he wrote quote the communist party of the united states has betrayed itself
it has turned itself into the traditional lever of a foreign power to overthrow the government of the united states
not in the name of freedom or high ideals
but in servile conformity to the wishes of the soviet union and in anticipation of soviet russia's complete domination of the american continent
there can be no sympathy for those who have turned the idea of communism into a vile curse to western man
the soviets have committed crimes unsurpassed even by their early day capitalist counterparts the imprisonment of their own peoples
with the mass extermination so typical of stalin and the individual suppression and regimentation under khrushchev
the deportations the purposeful curtailment of diet in the consumer slighted population of russia
the murder of history the prostitution of art and culture end quote
a suggestion that oswald hated more than just capitalism and communism
is provided by the following which was apparently written either on the ship coming back or after his return from the soviet union quote
i have often wondered why it is that the communist anarchist capitalist and even the fascist and anarchist elements in american
always profess patriotism toward the land and the people if not the government although their ideals movements must surely lead
to the bitter destruction of all and everything i am quite sure these people must hate not only the government
but our the people culture traditions heritage and very people itself and yet
they stand up and piously pronounce themselves patriots displaying their war medals that they gained in conflicts long past between themselves
i wonder what would happen it somebody was to stand up and say he was utterly opposed not only to the governments but to the people
to the entire land and complete foundations of his society end quote
oswald demonstrated his thinking in connection with his return to the united states by preparing two sets of identical questions of the type which he might have thought
he would be asked at a press conference when he returned
with either great ambivalence or cold calculation he prepared completely different answers to the same questions
judged by his other statements and writings however he appears to have indicated his true feelings in the set of answers first presented
and to have stated in the second what he thought would be least harmful to him as he resumed life in the united states
for example in response to his questions about his decision to go to the soviet union his first draft answered quote
as a mark of discuss and protest against american political policies in foreign countries my personal sign of discontent
and horror at the misguided line of reasoning of the united states government end quote
his second answer was that he quote went as a citizen of the u s as a tourist residing in a foreign country which i have a perfect right to do
i went there to see the land the people and how their system works end quote
to the question of quote are you a communist end quote he first answered yes
basically although i hate the ussr and socialist system i still think marxism can work under different circumstances end quote
his second answer to this question was quote no of course not
i have never even know a communist outside of the ones in the ussr but you can't help that end quote
his first set of questions and answers indicated his belief that there were no outstanding differences between the soviet union and the united states
quote except in the us the living standard is a little higher
freedoms are about the same medical aid and the educational system in the ussr is better than in the usa end quote
in the second simulated transcript which ended with the statement quote newspapers thank you sir you are a real patriot end quote
he apparently concluded that the united states offered quote
freedom of speech travel outspoken opposition to unpopular policies freedom to believe in god end quote while the soviet union did not
despite the hatred that oswald expressed toward the soviet union after his residence there
he continued to be interested in that country after he returned to the united states
soon after his arrival he wrote to the soviet embassy in washington
requesting information on how to subscribe to russian newspapers and magazines and asked for quote
oswald subsequently did subscribe to several soviet journals
while marina oswald tried to obtain permission to return to the soviet union she testified that she did so at her husband's insistence
in july of nineteen sixty three oswald also requested the soviet union to provide a visa for his return to that country
in august of nineteen sixty three he gave the new orleans police as a reason for refusing to permit his family to learn english
that quote he hated america and he did not want them to become americanized and that his plans were to go back to russia end quote
even though his primary purpose probably was to get to cuba
he sought an immediate grant of visa on his trip to mexico city in late september of nineteen sixty three
he also inquired about visas for himself and his wife

the warren commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy chapter seven lee harvey oswald
background and possible motives part four
personal relations
apart from his relatives oswald had no friends or close associates in texas when he returned there in june of nineteen sixty two
and he did not establish any close friendships or associations although it appears that he came to respect george de mohrenschildt
somewhat of a nonconformist
de mohrenschildt was a peripheral member of the so called russian community with which oswald made contact through mister peter gregory
a russian speaking petroleum engineer whom oswald met as a result of his contact with the texas employment commission office in fort worth
some of the members of that group saw a good deal of the oswalds through the fall of nineteen sixty three
and attempted to help misess oswald particularly in various ways in general oswald did not like the members of the russian community
in fact his relations with some of them particularly george bouhe became quite hostile
part of the problem resulted from the fact that as jeanne de mohrenschildt testified
oswald was quote very very disagreeable and disappointed end quote
he also expressed considerable resentment at the help given to his wife by her russian american friends
jeanne de mohrenschildt said quote
marina had a hundred dresses given to her and he objected to that lavish help because marina was throwing it into his face
he was offensive with the people and i can understand why because that hurt him
he could never give her what the people were showering on her no matter how hard he worked and he worked very hard end quote
the relations between oswald and his wife became such that bouhe wanted to liberate her from oswald
while the exact sequence of events is not clear because of conflicting testimony
it appears that de mohrenschildt and his wife actually went to oswald's apartment early in november of nineteen sixty two
and helped to move the personal effects of marina oswald and the baby
even though it appears that they may have left oswald a few days before it seems that he resisted the move as best he could
he even threatened to tear up his wife's dresses and break all the baby things according to de mohrenschildt
oswald submitted to the inevitable presumably because he was quote small you know and he was rather a puny individual end quote
de mohrenschildt said that the whole affair made him nervous since he was quote interfering in other people's affairs after all end quote
oswald attempted to get his wife to come back and over bouhe's protest de mohrenschildt finally told him where she was
de mohrenschildt admitted that quote
if somebody did that to me a lousy trick like that to take my wife away and all the furniture i would be mad as hell too
i am surprised that he didn't do something worse end quote
after about a two week separation marina oswald returned to her husband
bouhe thoroughly disapproved of this and as a result almost all communication between the oswalds and members of the russian community ceased
contacts with de mohrenschildt and his wife did continue and they saw the oswalds occasionally until the spring of nineteen sixty three
shortly after his return from the soviet union oswald severed all relations with his mother
he did not see his brother robert from thanksgiving of nineteen sixty two until november twenty three nineteen sixty three
at the time of his defection oswald had said that neither his brother robert
nor his mother were objects of his affection quote but only examples of workers in the u s end quote
he also indicated to officials at the american embassy in moscow that his defection was motivated at least in part
by so called exploitation of his mother by the capitalist system
consistent with this attitude
he first told his wife that he did not have a mother but later admitted that he did but that quote he didn't love her very much end quote
when they arrived from the soviet union oswald and his family lived at first with his brother robert
the latter testified that they quote were just together again end quote as if his brother quote had not been to russia end quote
he also said that he and his family got along well with marina oswald and enjoyed showing her american things
after about a month with his brother
oswald and his family lived for a brief period with his mother at her urging but oswald soon decided to move out
marguerite oswald visited her son and his family at the first apartment which he rented after his return and tried to help them get settled there
after she had bought some clothes for marina oswald and a highchair for the baby oswald emphatically told her to stop
as marguerite oswald testified quote
he strongly put me in my place about buying things for his wife that he himself could not buy end quote
oswald objected to his mother visiting the apartment
and became quite incensed with his wife when she would open the door for her in spite of his instructions to the contrary
oswald moved to dallas on about october eight nineteen sixty two without telling his mother where he was going
he never saw or communicated with her in any way again until she came to see him after the assassination
even though oswald cut off relations with his mother
he attempted for the first time to learn something about his family background when he went to new orleans in april of nineteen sixty three
he visited some of his father's elderly relatives and the cemetery where his father was buried in an effort to develop the facts of his genealogy
while it does not appear that he established any new relationships as a result of his investigation he did obtain a large picture of his father
from one of the elderly relatives with whom he spoke oswald's interest in such things presents a sharp contrast with his attitude
at the time of his defection when he evidenced no interest in his father and hardly mentioned him even when questioned
oswald's defection his interest in the soviet union and his activities on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee
not only caused him difficulties in his employment relations but they also provided him with excuses for employment failures
which were largely of his own making
oswald experienced some difficulty finding employment perhaps this was partially because of his lack of any specific skill or training
some of his acquaintances feeling that oswald tried to impress people with the fact that he had lived and worked in russia were led to the belief
that his employment difficulties were caused by his telling prospective employers that he had last been employed in minsk
while he might have expected difficulty from such an approach in fact
the evidence indicates that oswald usually told his prospective employers and employment counselors that he had recently been discharged from the marine corps
oswald obtained a job in july of nineteen sixty two as a sheet metal worker with a company in fort worth
his performance for that company was satisfactory
even though he told his wife that he had been fired he voluntarily left on october eight nineteen sixty two and moved to dallas
on october nine nineteen sixty two he went to the dallas office of the texas employment commission
where he expressed a reluctance to work in the industrial field
he indicated an interest in writing an employment counselor testified on the basis of a general aptitude test oswald had taken
that he had some aptitude in that area quote because the verbal score is high and the clerical score is high end quote
while that counselor found that he was qualified to handle many different types of jobs
because of his need for immediate employment she attempted to obtain for him any job that was available at the time oswald made qualifying marks
in nineteen of twenty three categories included on the general aptitude examination and scored one hundred twenty seven on the verbal test as compared
with fifty percent of the people taking it who score less than one hundred
the counselor testified that there was some indication that oswald was capable of doing college work
and noted that oswald's verbal and clerical potential was quote outstanding end quote
employment commission records concerning oswald stated quote well groomed and spoken
business suit alert replies expresses self extremely well end quote
oswald said that he hoped eventually to develop qualifications for employment as a junior executive
through a work study program at a local college
he indicated however that he would have to delay that program because of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities
on october eleven nineteen sixty two the employment commission referred oswald
to a commercial advertising photography firm in dallas where he was employed as a trainee starting october twelve nineteen sixty two
even though oswald indicated that he liked photographic work his employer found that he was not an efficient worker
he was not able to produce photographic work
which adhered with sufficient precision to the job specifications and as a result too much of his work had to be redone
he also had difficulty in working with the other employees
this was at least in part because of the close physical confines in which some of the work had to be done
he did not seem to be able to make the accommodations necessary when people work under such conditions and as a result
became involved in conflicts some of which were fairly heated with his fellow employees
in february or march of nineteen sixty three
it began to appear that oswald was having considerable difficulty doing accurate work and in getting along with the other employees
it appears that his discharge was hastened by the fact that he brought a russian language newspaper to work
it is not possible to tell whether oswald did this to provide an excuse for his eventual discharge
or whether he brought the russian language newspaper with him one day after his other difficulties became clear
it is possible that his immediate supervisor noticed the newspaper at that time because his attention had otherwise been drawn more directly to oswald
in any event oswald was discharged on april six nineteen sixty three ostensibly because of his inefficiency and difficult personality
his supervisor admitted however
that while he did not fire oswald because of the newspaper incident or even weigh it heavily in his decision quote
it didn't do his case any good end quote
upon moving to new orleans on april twenty four nineteen sixty three
oswald's employment problems became more difficult he left his wife and child at the home of a friend misess ruth paine of irving texas
in new orleans he obtained work as a greaser and oiler of coffee processing machines for the william b reily company
beginning may ten nineteen sixty three
after securing this job and an apartment oswald asked his wife to join him
misess paine brought oswald's family to new orleans
refusing to admit that he could only get work as a greaser
oswald told his wife and misess paine that he was working as a commercial photographer
he lost his job on july nineteen nineteen sixty three because his work was not satisfactory
and because he spent too much time loitering in the garage next door where he read rifle and hunting magazines
oswald apparently concluded that his fair play for cuba committee activities were not related to his discharge
the correctness of that conclusion is supported by the fact that he does not seem to have been publicly identified with that organization until august nine
nineteen sixty three almost a month after he lost his job
his fair play for cuba committee activities however made it more difficult for him to obtain other employment
a placement interviewer of the louisiana department of labor
who had previously interviewed oswald saw him on television and heard a radio debate in which he engaged on august twenty one nineteen sixty three
he consulted with his supervisor and quote it was determined that we should not undertake to furnish employment references for him end quote
ironically he failed to get a job in another photographic firm after his return to dallas in october of nineteen sixty three
because the president of the photographic firm for which he had previously worked
told the prospective employer that oswald was quote kinda peculiar sometimes and that he had some knowledge of the russian language end quote
and that he quote may be a damn communist i can't tell you if i was you i wouldn't hire him end quote
the plant superintendent of the new firm testified that one of the employees of the old firm quote
implied that oswald's fellow employees did not like him because he was propagandizing
and had been seen reading a foreign newspaper end quote
as a result oswald was not hired
he subsequently found a job with the texas school book depository for which he performed his duties satisfactorily
attack on general walker
the commission has concluded that on april ten nineteen sixty three
oswald shot at major general edwin a walker resigned u s army
demonstrating once again his propensity to act dramatically and in this instance violently in furtherance of his beliefs
the shooting occurred two weeks before oswald moved to new orleans and a few days after he had been discharged by the photographic firm
as indicated in chapter four oswald had been planning his attack on general walker for at least one and perhaps as much as two months
he outlined his plans in a notebook and studied them at considerable length before his attack
he also studied dallas bus schedules to prepare for his later use of buses to travel to and from general walker's house
sometime after march twenty seven but according to marina oswald prior to april ten nineteen sixty three
oswald posed for two pictures
with his recently acquired rifle and pistol a copy of the march twenty four nineteen sixty three issue of the worker
and the march eleven nineteen sixty three issue of the militant
he told his wife that he wanted to send the pictures to the militant and he also asked her to keep one of the pictures for his daughter june
following his unsuccessful attack on walker oswald returned home
he had left a note for his wife telling her what to do in case he were apprehended as well as his notebook and the pictures of himself holding the rifle
she testified that she was agitated because she had found the note in oswald's room
where she had gone contrary to his instructions after she became worried about his absence
she indicated that she had no advance knowledge of oswald's plans
that she became quite angry when oswald told her what he had done and that she made him promise never to repeat such a performance
she said that she kept the note to use against him quote if something like that should be repeated again end quote
when asked if oswald requested the note back she testified that quote he forgot about it but apparently
after he thought that what he had written in his book might be proof against him and he destroyed it the book end quote
she later gave the following testimony question
after he brought the rifle home then he showed you the book
answer yes question and you said it was not a good idea to keep this book answer yes
question and then he burned the book
answer yes
question did you ask him why he had not destroyed the book before he actually went to shoot general walker
answer it never came to me myself to ask him that question
marina oswald's testimony indicates that her husband was not particularly concerned about his continued possession of the most incriminating sort of evidence
if he had been successful and had been apprehended even for routine questioning his apartment would undoubtedly have been searched
and his role would have been made clear by the evidence which he had left behind
leaving the note and picture as he did would seem to indicate that he had considered the possibility of capture
possibly he might have wanted to be caught and wanted his involvement made clear if he was in fact apprehended
even after his wife told him to destroy the notebook
he removed at least some of the pictures which had been pasted in it and saved them among his effects where they were found after the assassination
his behavior was entirely consistent with his wife's testimony that quote
i asked him what for he was making all these entries in the book and he answered that he wanted to leave a complete record so that all the details would be in it
i am guessing that perhaps he did it to appear to be a brave man in case he were arrested but that is my supposition end quote
the attempt on general walker's life deserves close attention in any consideration of oswald's possible motive for the assassination
and the trail of evidence he left behind him on that occasion
while there are differences between the two events as far as oswald's actions and planning are concerned there are also similarities that should be considered
the items which oswald left at home when he made his attack on walker suggest a strong concern for his place in history
if the attack had succeeded and oswald had been caught the pictures showing him with his rifle
and his communist and socialist worker's party newspapers would probably have appeared on the front pages of newspapers or magazines all over the country
as in fact one of them did appear after the assassination
the circumstances of the attack on walker coupled with other indications that oswald was concerned about his place in history
and with the circumstances surrounding the assassination have led the commission to believe
that such concern is an important factor to consider in assessing possible motivation for the assassination
in any event the walker incident indicates that in spite of the belief among those who knew him that he was apparently not dangerous
oswald did not lack the determination and other traits required
to carry out a carefully planned killing of another human being and was willing to consummate such a purpose if he thought there was sufficient reason to do so
some idea of what he thought was sufficient reason for such an act may be found in the nature of the motive that he stated for his attack on general walker
marina oswald indicated that her husband had compared general walker to adolph hitler
she testified that oswald said that general walker quote was a very bad man that he was a fascist
that he was the leader of a fascist organization and when i said that even though all of that might be true just the same he had no right to take his life

lee harvey oswald background and possible motives part five
political activities
oswald's political activities after his return to the united states center around his interest in cuba and in the fair play for cuba committee
although as indicated above the commission has been unable to find any credible evidence
that he was involved in any conspiracy his political activities do provide insight into certain aspects of oswald's character
and into his possible motivation for the assassination
while it appears that he may have distributed fair play for cuba committee materials on one uneventful occasion in dallas sometime during the period
april six to twenty four nineteen sixty three oswald's first public identification with that cause was in new orleans
there in late may and early june of nineteen sixty three under the name lee osborne
he had printed a handbill headed in large letters quote
hands off cuba end quote an application form for and a membership card in
the new orleans branch of the fair play for cuba committee
he first distributed his handbills and other material uneventfully in the vicinity of the u s s wasp
which was berthed at the dumaine street wharf in new orleans on june sixteen nineteen sixty three
he distributed literature in downtown new orleans on august nine nineteen sixty three
and was arrested because of a dispute with three anti castro cuban exiles and again on august sixteen nineteen sixty three
following his arrest he was interviewed by the police and at his own request by an agent of the fbi
on august seventeen nineteen sixty three he appeared briefly on a radio program and on august twenty one nineteen sixty three
he debated over radio station w d s u new orleans with carlos bringuier
one of the cuban exiles who had been arrested with him on august nine bringuier claimed that on august five nineteen sixty three
oswald had attempted to infiltrate an anti castro organization with which he was associated
while oswald publicly engaged in the activities described above his quote organization end quote was a product of his imagination
the imaginary president of the nonexistent chapter was named a j hidell the name that oswald used when he purchased the assassination weapon
marina oswald said she signed that name apparently chosen because it rhymed with fidel
to her husband's membership card in the new orleans chapter
she testified that he threatened to beat her if she did not do so the chapter had never been chartered by the national fpcc organization
it appears to have been a solitary operation on oswald's part in spite of his misstatements to the new orleans police that it had thirty five members
five of which were usually present at meetings which were held once a month
oswald's fair play for cuba activities may be viewed as a very shrewd political operation
in which one man single handedly created publicity for his cause or for himself
it is also evidence of oswald's reluctance to describe events accurately
and of his need to present himself to others as well as to himself in a light more favorable than was justified by reality
this is suggested by his misleading and sometime untruthful statements in his letters to mister v t lee
then national director of fpcc in one of those letters dated august one nineteen sixty three
oswald wrote that an office which he had previously claimed to have rented for fpcc activities had been quote
promptly closed three days later for some obscure reasons by the renters
they said something about remodeling etc i'm sure you understand end quote
he wrote that quote thousands of circulars were distributed end quote
and that he continued to receive inquiries through his post office box which he endeavored quote to keep answering to the best of my ability end quote
in his letter to v t lee
he stated that he was then alone in his efforts on behalf of fpcc but he attributed his lack of support
to an attack by cuban exiles in a street demonstration and being quote officialy cautioned end quote by the police
events which quote robbed me of what support i had leaving me alone end quote
that anyone ever attacked any street demonstration in which oswald was involved except for the bringuier incident mentioned above
which occurred eight days after oswald wrote the above letter to v t lee
bringuier who seemed to be familiar with many anti castro activities in new orleans was not aware of any such incident
police reports also fail to reflect any activity on oswald's part prior to august nine nineteen sixty three
except for the uneventful distribution of literature at the dumaine street wharf in june
furthermore the general tenor of oswald's next letter to v t lee
in which he supported his report on the bringuier incident with a copy of the charges made against him
and a newspaper clipping reporting the event suggests that his previous story of an attack by cuban exiles was at least greatly exaggerated
while the legend quote fpcc five four four camp street new orleans louisiana end quote
was stamped on some literature that oswald had in his possession at the time of his arrest in new orleans
extensive investigation was not able to connect oswald with that address although it did develop the fact
that an anti castro organization had maintained offices there for a period ending early in nineteen sixty two
the commission has not been able to find any other indication that oswald had rented an office in new orleans
in view of the limited amount of public activity on oswald's part before august nine nineteen sixty three
there also seems to be no basis for his claim that he had distributed quote
thousands end quote of circulars especially since he had claimed to have printed only two thousand
and actually had only one thousand printed
in addition there is no evidence that he received any substantial amount of materials from the national headquarters
in another letter to v t lee dated august seventeen nineteen sixty three
oswald wrote that he had appeared on mister william stuckey's fifteen minute television program over w d s u tv called quote
latin american focus end quote
as a result of which he was quote flooded with callers and invitations to debates etc as well as people interested in joining the f p c c
new orleans branch end quote
w d s u has no program of any kind called quote latin american focus end quote
stuckey had a radio program called quote latin listening post end quote
on which oswald was heard for less than five minutes on august seventeen nineteen sixty three
it appears that oswald had only one caller in response to all of his fpcc activities
an agent of bringuier's attempting to learn more about the true nature
of the alleged fpcc quote organization end quote in new orleans
oswald's statements suggest that he hoped to be flooded with callers and invitations to debate
this would have made him a real center of attention as he must have been when he first arrived in the soviet union
and as he was to some extent when he returned to the united states
the limited notoriety that oswald received as a result of the street fracas and in the subsequent radio debate
was apparently not enough to satisfy him he exaggerated in his letters to v t lee in an apparent attempt
to make himself and his activities appear far more important than they really were
his attempt to express himself through his fair play for cuba activities however
was greatly impeded by the fact that the radio debate over w d s u on august twenty one nineteen sixty three
brought out the history of his defection to the soviet union
the basic facts of the event were uncovered independently by william stuckey who arranged the debate and edward butler
executive director of the information council of the americas who also appeared on the program
oswald was confronted with those facts at the beginning of the debate and was so thrown on the defensive by this that he was forced to state that
fair play for cuba was quote not at all communist controlled regardless of the fact that i had the experience of living in russia end quote
stuckey testified that uncovering oswald's defection was very important quote
i think that we finished him on that program because we had publicly linked the fair play for cuba committee
with a fellow who had lived in russia for three years and who was an admitted marxist
the interesting thing or rather the danger involved was the fact that oswald seemed like such a nice bright boy
and was extremely believable before this we thought the fellow could probably get quite a few members if he was really indeed serious about getting members
we figured after this broadcast of august twenty one why that was no longer possible end quote
in spite of the fact that oswald had been surprised and was on the defensive throughout the debate according to stuckey quote
mister oswald handled himself very well as usual end quote
stuckey thought oswald quote appeared to be a very logical intelligent fellow end quote and quote was arrested by his cleancutness end quote
he did not think oswald looked like the quote type end quote that he would have expected to find associating with a group such as the fair play for cuba committee
stuckey thought that oswald acted very much as would a young attorney
following the disclosure of his defection oswald sought advice from the communist party u s a concerning his fair play for cuba activity
he had previously sent apparently unsolicited to the party newspaper the worker
samples of his photographic work offering to contribute that sort of service without charge
the worker replied quote your kind offer is most welcomed and from time to time we shall call on you end quote
he later wrote to another official of the worker seeking employment and mentioning the praise he had received for submitting his photographic work
he presented arnold johnson gus hall
and benjamin j davis honorary membership cards in his nonexistent new orleans chapter of the fair play for cuba committee
and advised them of some of his activities on behalf of the organization
arnold johnson director of the information and lecture bureau of the communist party u s a replied stating quote
it is good to know that movements in support of fair play for cuba has developed in new orleans as well as in other cities
we do not have any organizational ties with the committee and yet there is much material that we issue from time to time that is important
for anybody who is concerned about developments in cuba end quote
marina oswald said that such correspondence from people he considered important meant much to oswald
after he had begun his cuban activity in new orleans quote
he received a letter from somebody in new york some communist probably from new york i am not sure from where from some communist leader and he was very happy
he felt that this was a great man that he had received the letter from end quote
since he seemed to feel that no one else understood his political views the letter was of great value to him for it quote was proof
that there were people who understood his activity end quote
he anticipated that the full disclosure of his defection would hinder him in quote the struggle for progress and freedom in the united states end quote
into which oswald in his own words had quote thrown himself he sought advice from the central committee of the communist party u s a
in a letter dated august twenty eight nineteen sixty three about whether he could quote continue to fight
handicapped as it were by my past record and compete with anti progressive forces above ground or whether in your opinion
i should always remain in the background i e underground end quote
stating that he had used his position with what he claimed to be the local branch of the fair play for cuba committee to quote foster communist ideals end quote
oswald wrote that he felt that he might have compromised the fpcc and expressed concern lest quote our opponents could use my background
of residence in the u s s r against any cause which i join by association
they could say the organization of which i am a member is russian controlled etc end quote
in reply arnold johnson advised oswald that while as an american citizen he had a right to participate in such organizations as he wished quote
there are a number of organizations including possibly fair play which are of a very broad character
and often it is advisable for some people to remain in the background not underground end quote
by august of nineteen sixty three after a short three months in new orleans the city in which he had been born and had lived most of his early life
oswald had fallen on difficult times
he had not liked his job as a greaser of coffee processing machinery and he held it for only a little over two months
he had not found another job his wife was expecting their second child in october and there was concern about the cost which would be involved
his brief foray on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee had failed to win any support
while he had drawn some attention to himself and had actually appeared on two radio programs he had been attacked by cuban exiles and arrested
an event which his wife thought upset him and as a result of which quote he became less active he cooled off a little end quote
more seriously the facts of his defection had become known leaving him open to almost unanswerable attack by those who opposed his views
it would not have been possible to have followed arnold johnson's advice to remain in the background
since there was no background to the new orleans fpcc quote organization end quote which consisted solely of oswald
furthermore he had apparently not received any letters from the national headquarters of fpcc since may twenty nine nineteen sixty three
even though he had written four detailed letters since that time to mister v t lee and had also kept the national headquarters informed
of each of his changes of mailing address
those events no doubt had their effects on oswald
interest in cuba
by august of nineteen sixty three oswald had for some time been considering the possibility of leaving the united states again
on june twenty four nineteen sixty three he applied for a new passport
and in late june or early july he told his wife that he wanted to return to the soviet union with her she said that he was extremely upset
very unhappy and that he actually wept when he told her that
he said that nothing kept him in the united states that he would not lose anything if he returned to the soviet union that he wanted to be with her
and that it would be better to have less and not have to be concerned about tomorrow
as a result of that conversation marina oswald wrote the soviet embassy in washington concerning a request she had first made
on february seventeen nineteen sixty three for permission for herself and june to return to the soviet union
while that first request made according to marina oswald at her husband's insistence specifically stated that oswald was to remain in the united states
she wrote in her letter of july nineteen sixty three
that things are improving due to the fact that my husband expresses a sincere wish to return together with me to the ussr unknown to his wife however
oswald apparently enclosed a note with her letter of july in which
he requested the embassy to rush his wife's entrance visa because of the impending birth of the second child but stated that quote
as for my return entrance visa please consider it separately end quote
thus while oswald's real intentions assuming that they were known to himself are not clear
he may not have intended to go to the soviet union directly if at all it appears that he really wanted to go to cuba
in his wife's words quote
i only know that his basic desire was to get to cuba by any means and that all the rest of it was window dressing for that purpose end quote
marina oswald testified that her husband engaged in fair play for cuba committee activities quote
primarily for purposes of self advertising
he wanted to be arrested i think he wanted to get into the newspapers so that he would be known end quote
according to marina oswald he thought that would help him when he got to cuba
he asked his wife to help him to hijack an airplane to get there but gave up that scheme when she refused
during this period oswald may have practiced opening and closing the bolt on his rifle in a screened porch in his apartment
in september he began to review spanish
he approved arrangements for his family to return to irving texas to live with misess ruth paine
on september twenty nineteen sixty three misess paine and her two children arrived in new orleans from a trip to the east coast
and left for irving with marina oswald and june and most of the oswalds effects three days later
while marina oswald knew of her husband's plan to go to mexico and thence to cuba if possible misess paine was told that oswald was going to houston
and possibly to philadelphia to look for work
oswald left for mexico city on september twenty five nineteen sixty three and arrived on september twenty seven nineteen sixty three
he went almost directly to the cuban embassy and applied for a visa to cuba in transit to russia
representing himself as the head of the new orleans branch of the quote organization called fair play for cuba end quote
he stated his desire that he should be accepted as a friend of the cuban revolution
he apparently based his claim for a visa in transit to russia
on his previous residence his work permit for that country and several unidentified letters in the russian language
the cubans would not however give him a visa until he had received one from the soviets which involved a delay of several months
when faced with that situation oswald became greatly agitated and although he later unsuccessfully attempted
to obtain a soviet visa at the soviet embassy in mexico city he insisted that he was entitled to the cuban visa because of his background
partisanship and personal activities on behalf of the cuban government
he engaged in an angry argument with the consul who finally told him that quote as far as he was concerned
he would not give him a visa end quote and that quote
a person like him oswald in place of aiding the cuban revolution was doing it harm end quote
oswald must have been thoroughly disillusioned when he left mexico city on october two nineteen sixty three
in spite of his former residence in the soviet union and his fair play for cuba committee activities he had been rebuffed
by the officials of both cuba and the soviet union in mexico city
now there appeared to be no chance to get to cuba where he had thought he might find his communist ideal the u s government would not permit travel there
and as far as the performance of the cubans themselves was concerned he was quote disappointed at not being able to get to cuba
and he didn't have any great desire to do so any more because he had run into as he himself said into bureaucracy and red tape end quote
oswald's attempt to go to cuba
was another act which expressed his hostility toward the united states and its institutions as well as a concomitant attachment
to a country in which he must have thought were embodied the political principles to which he had been committed for so long
it should be noted that his interest in cuba seems to have increased along with the sense of frustration which must have developed
as he experienced successive failures in his jobs in his political activity and in his personal relationships
in retrospect his attempt to go to cuba or return to the soviet union may well have been oswald's last escape hatch
his last gambit to extricate himself from the mediocrity and defeat which plagued him throughout most of his life
oswald's activities with regard to cuba raise serious questions as to how much he might have been motivated in the assassination
by a desire to aid the castro regime which president kennedy so outspokenly criticized
for example the dallas times herald of november nineteen nineteen sixty three
prominently reported president kennedy as having quote all but invited the cuban people today to overthrow fidel castro's communist regime
and promised prompt u s aid if they do end quote
the castro regime severely attacked president kennedy in connection with the bay of pigs affair the cuban missile crisis the ban on travel to cuba
the economic embargo against that country and the general policy of the united states with regard to cuba
an examination of the militant to which oswald subscribed
for the three month period prior to the assassination reflects an extremely critical attitude toward president kennedy and his administration
concerning cuban policy in general as well as on the issues of automation and civil rights issues which appeared to concern oswald a great deal
the militant also reflected a critical attitude toward president kennedy's attempts to reduce tensions between the united states and the soviet union
it also dealt with the fear of the castro regime that such a policy might result in its abandonment by the soviet union
the october seven nineteen sixty three issue of the militant
reported castro as saying cuba could not accept a situation where at the same time the united states was trying to ease world tensions
it also was increasing its efforts to tighten the noose around cuba
was also reported in the october one nineteen sixty three issue of the worker to which oswald also subscribed
in this connection it should be noted that in speaking of the worker oswald told michael paine apparently in all seriousness that quote
you could tell what they wanted you to do by reading between the lines reading the thing and doing a little reading between the lines end quote
the general conflict of views between the united states and cuba was of course reflected in other media to such an extent
that there can be no doubt that oswald was aware generally of the critical attitude that castro expressed about president kennedy
oswald was asked during the new orleans radio debate in which he engaged on august twenty one nineteen sixty three
whether or not he agreed with castro that president kennedy was a quote ruffian and a thief end quote he replied that he quote
would not agree with that particular wording end quote
it should also be noted however that one witness testified that shortly before the assassination
oswald had expressed approval of president kennedy's active role in the area of civil rights
although oswald could possibly have been motivated in part by his sympathy for the castro government
it should be remembered that his wife testified that he was disappointed with his failure to get to cuba
and had lost his desire to do so because of the bureaucracy and red tape which he had encountered
his unhappy experience with the cuban consul seems thus to have reduced his enthusiasm for the castro regime and his desire to go to cuba
while some of castro's more severe criticisms of president kennedy might have led oswald to believe that he would be well received in cuba
after he had assassinated the american president it does not appear that he had any plans to go there
oswald was carrying only thirteen dollars eighty seven cents at the time of his arrest although he had left apparently by design
one hundred seventy dollars in a wallet in his wife's room in irving
if there was no conspiracy which would help him escape the possibility of which has been considered in chapter six
it is unlikely that a reasoning person would plan to attempt to travel from dallas texas to cuba
with thirteen dollars eighty seven cents when considerably greater resources were available to him
the fact that oswald left behind the funds which might have enabled him to reach cuba suggests the absence of any plan to try to flee there
and raises serious questions as to whether or not he ever expected to escape
report of the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy the warren commission report by the president's commission on the assassination of president kennedy
chapter seven lee harvey oswald background and possible motives part six
possible influence of anti kennedy sentiment in dallas
it has been suggested that one of the motivating influences operating on lee oswald was the atmosphere in the city of dallas
especially an atmosphere of extreme opposition to president kennedy that was present in some parts of the dallas community
and which received publicity there prior to the assassination
some of that feeling was expressed in the incident involving then vice presidential candidate johnson during the nineteen sixty campaign
in the treatment of ambassador adlai stevenson late in october of nineteen sixty three
and in the extreme anti kennedy newspaper advertisement and handbills that appeared in dallas at the time of the president's visit there
the commission has found no evidence that the extreme views expressed toward president kennedy
by some rightwing groups centered in dallas or any other general atmosphere of hate
or rightwing extremism which may have existed in the city of dallas had any connection with oswald's actions on november twenty two nineteen sixty three
there is of course no way to judge what the effect of the general political ferment present in that city might have been even though oswald was aware of it
his awareness is shown by a letter that he wrote to arnold johnson of the communist party u s a
which johnson said he did not receive until after the assassination the letter said in part quote
on october twenty third i had attended a ultra right meeting headed by general edwin a walker who lives in dallas
this meeting preceded by one day the attack on a e stevenson at the united nations day meeting at which he spoke
as you can see political friction between left and right is very great here
could you advise me as to the general view we have on the american civil liberties union end quote
in any event the commission has been unable to find any credible evidence that oswald had direct contact or association with
any of the personalities or groups epitomizing or representing the so called right wing
even though he did as he told johnson attend a meeting at which general walker spoke to approximately thirteen hundred persons
oswald's writings and his reading habits indicate that he had an extreme dislike of the right wing an attitude most clearly reflected by his attempt
to shoot general walker
relationship with wife
the relations between lee and marina oswald are of great importance in any attempt to understand oswald's possible motivation
during the period from oswald's return from mexico to the assassination
he and his wife spent every weekend but one together at the irving texas home of misess ruth paine who was then separated from her husband
the sole exception was the weekend of november sixteen to seventeen nineteen sixty three the weekend before the assassination
when his wife asked oswald not to come to irving
during the week oswald lived in a roominghouse in dallas but he usually called his wife on the telephone twice a day
she testified that after his return from mexico oswald quote changed for the better
he began to treat me better he helped me more although he always did help but he was more attentive end quote
marina oswald attributed that to their living apart and to the imminent birth of their second child
she testified that oswald quote was very happy end quote about the birth of the child
while those considerations no doubt had an effect on oswald's attitude toward his family it would seem that the need for support and sympathy
after his recent rebuffs in mexico city
might also have been important to him it would not have been the first time that oswald sought closer ties with his family in time of adversity
his past relationships with his wife had been stormy however and it did not seem that she respected him very much
they had been married after a courtship of only about six weeks a part of which oswald spent in the hospital
oswald's diary reports that he married his wife shortly after his proposal of marriage to another girl had been rejected
he stated that the other girl rejected him partly because he was an american a fact that he said she had exploited he stated that quote
in spite of fact i married marina to hurt ella the girl that had rejected him i found myself in love with marina end quote
many of the people with whom the oswalds became acquainted after their arrival in the united states thought that marina oswald had married her husband primarily in the hope
that she would be able to leave the soviet union marina oswald has denied this
marina oswald expressed one aspect of her husband's attitude toward her when she testified that quote lee wanted me to go to russia
and i told him that
if he wanted me to go then that meant that he didn't love me and that in that case what was the idea of coming to the united states in the first place
lee would say that it would be better for me if i went to russia i did not know why i did not know what he had in mind
he said he loved me but that it would be better for me if i went to russia and what he had in mind i don't know end quote
on the other hand oswald objected to the invitation that his wife had received to live with misess ruth paine
which misess paine had made in part to give her an alternative to returning to the soviet union marina oswald wrote to misess paine that quote
many times oswald has recalled this matter to me and said that i am just waiting for an opportunity to hurt him
it has been the cause of many of our arguments end quote oswald claimed that his wife preferred others to him
he said this about members of the russian speaking group in the dallas fort worth area whom she said he tried to forbid her from seeing
and also about misess paine
he specifically made that claim when his wife refused to come to live with him in dallas as he asked her to do on the evening of november twenty one
nineteen sixty three
the instability of their relations was probably a function of the personalities of both people oswald was overbearing in relations with his wife
he apparently attempted to be the commander by dictating many of the details of their married life
while marina oswald said that her husband wanted her to learn english
he made no attempt to help her and there are other indications that he did not want her to learn that language
oswald apparently wished to continue practicing his own russian with her lieutenant martello of the new orleans police testified
that oswald stated that he did not speak english in his family because he did not want them to become americanized
marina oswald's inability to speak english also made it more difficult for her to have an independent existence in this country
oswald struck his wife on occasion
did not want her to drink smoke or wear cosmetics and generally treated her with lack of respect in the presence of others
the difficulties which oswald's problems would have caused him in any relationship were probably not reduced by his wife's conduct
katherine ford with whom marina oswald stayed during her separation from her husband in november of nineteen sixty two
thought that marina oswald was immature in her thinking and partly responsible for the difficulties that the oswalds were having at that time
misess ford said that marina oswald admitted that she provoked oswald on occasion
there can be little doubt that some provocation existed
oswald once struck his wife because of a letter which she wrote to a former boyfriend in russia
in the letter marina oswald stated that her husband had changed a great deal and that she was very lonely in the united states
she was quote sorry that i had not married him the russian boyfriend instead that it would have been much easier for me end quote
the letter fell into oswald's hands when it was returned to his post office box
because of insufficient postage which apparently resulted from an increase in postal rates of which his wife had been unaware
oswald read the letter but refused to believe that it was sincere even though his wife insisted to him that it was
as a result oswald struck her as to which she testified quote
generally i think that was right for such things that is the right thing to do there was some grounds for it end quote
although she denied it in some of her testimony before the commission
it appears that marina oswald also complained that her husband was not able to provide more material things for her
on that issue george de mohrenschildt who was probably as close to the oswalds as anyone else during their first stay in dallas
said that quote she was annoying him all the time
why don't you make some money poor guy was going out of his mind we told her she should not annoy him poor guy he is doing his best don't annoy him so much
the de mohrenschildts also testified that quote right in front end quote of oswald marina oswald complained about oswald's inadequacy as a husband
misess oswald told another of her friends that oswald was very cold to her that they very seldom had sexual relations
and that oswald quote was not a man end quote she also told misess paine that she was not satisfied with her sexual relations with oswald
marina oswald also ridiculed her husband's political views thereby tearing down his view of his own importance
he was very much interested in autobiographical works of outstanding statesmen of the united states to whom his wife thought he compared himself
she said he was different from other people in quote at least his imagination his fantasy which was quite unfounded
as to the fact that he was an outstanding man end quote
she said that she quote always tried to point out to him that he was a man like any others who were around us but he simply could not understand that end quote
jeanne de mohrenschildt however thought that marina oswald quote said things that will hurt men's pride end quote
she said that if she ever spoke to her husband the way marina oswald spoke to her husband quote we would not last long end quote
misess de mohrenschildt thought that oswald
whom she compared to quote a puppy dog that everybody kicked end quote had a lot of good qualities in spite of the fact that quote
nobody said anything good about him end quote
she had quote the impression that he was just pushed pushed pushed and she marina oswald was probably nagging nagging nagging end quote
she thought that he might not have become involved in the assassination if people had been kinder to him
in spite of these difficulties however and in the face of the economic problems that were always with them
things apparently went quite smoothly from the time oswald returned from mexico until the weekend of november sixteen to seventeen nineteen sixty three
misess paine was planning a birthday party for one of her children on that weekend and her husband michael was to be at the house
marina oswald said that she knew her husband did not like michael paine and so she asked him not to come out that weekend even though he wanted to do so
she testified that she told him quote
that he shouldn't come every week that perhaps it is not convenient for ruth that the whole family be there live there end quote
she testified that he responded quote as you wish if you don't want me to come i won't end quote
ruth paine testified that she heard marina oswald tell oswald about the birthday party
on sunday november seventeen nineteen sixty three
ruth paine and marina oswald decided to call oswald at the place where he was living unbeknownst to them under the name of o h lee
they asked for lee oswald who was not called to the telephone because he was known by the other name
when oswald called the next day his wife became very angry about his use of the alias he said that he used it because quote
he did not want his landlady to know his real name because she might read in the paper of the fact that he had been in russia and that he had been questioned end quote
oswald also said that he did not want the fbi to know where he lived quote because their visits were not very pleasant for him
and he thought that he loses jobs because the fbi visits the place of his employment end quote
while the facts of his defection had become known in new orleans as a result of his radio debate with bringuier
it would appear to be unlikely that his landlady in dallas
would see anything in the newspaper about his defection unless he engaged in activities similar to those
which had led to the disclosure of his defection in new orleans
furthermore even though it appears that at times oswald was really upset by visits of the fbi
it does not appear that he ever lost his job because of its activities although he may well not have been aware of that fact
while oswald's concern about the fbi had some basis in fact in that fbi agents had interviewed him in the past and had renewed their interest
to some extent after his fair play for cuba committee activities had become known he exaggerated their concern for him
marina oswald thought he did so in order to emphasize his importance
for example in his letter of november nine nineteen sixty three
to the soviet embassy in washington he asked about the entrance visas for which he and his wife had previously applied
he absolved the soviet embassy in mexico city of any blame for his difficulties there he advised the washington embassy
that the fbi was quote not now end quote interested in his fair play for cuba committee activities but noted that the fbi quote
has visited us here in dallas texas on november one agent james p hasty
warned me that if i engaged in f p c c activities in texas the f b i will again take an interest in me end quote
neither hosty nor any other agent of the fbi spoke to oswald on any subject from august ten nineteen sixty three
to the time of the assassination
the claimed warning was one more of oswald's fabrications
hosty had come to the paine residence on november one and five nineteen sixty three
but did not issue any such warning or suggest that marina oswald defect from the soviet union and remain in the united states under fbi protection
as oswald went on to say in oswald's imagination quote
i and my wife strongly protested these tactics by the notorious f b i end quote
in fact his wife testified that she only said that she would prefer not to receive any more visits from the bureau
because of the quote very exciting and disturbing effect end quote they had upon her husband who was not even present at that time
the arguments he used to justify his use of the alias suggest that oswald may have come to think that the whole world was becoming involved
in an increasingly complex conspiracy against him
he may have felt he could never tell when the fbi was going to appear on the scene or who else was going to find out about his defection
and use it against him as had been done in new orleans
on the other hand the concern he expressed about the fbi may have been just another story to support the objective he sought in his letter
those arguments however were not persuasive to marina oswald
to whom quote it was nothing terrible if people were to find out that he had been in russia end quote
she asked oswald quote
after all when will all your foolishness come to an end all of these comedies first one thing and then another and now this fictitious name end quote
she said quote
on monday november eighteen nineteen sixty three he called several times but after i hung up on him and didn't want to talk to him he did not call again
he then arrived on thursday november twenty one nineteen sixty three end quote
the events of that evening can best be appreciated through marina oswald's testimony
question did your husband give any reason for coming home on thursday
answer he said that he was lonely because he hadn't come the preceding weekend and he wanted to make his peace with me
question did you say anything to him then
answer he tried to talk to me but i would not answer him and he was very upset question were you upset with him
answer i was angry of course he was not angry he was upset i was angry he tried very hard to please me
he spent quite a bit of time putting away diapers and played with the children on the street
question how did you indicate to him that you were angry with him answer by not talking to him
question and how did he show that he was upset
he was upset over the fact that i would not answer him
he tried to start a conversation with me several times but i would not answer and he said that he didn't want me to be angry at him because this upsets him
on that day he suggested that we rent an apartment in dallas
he said that he was tired of living alone and perhaps the reason for my being so angry was the fact that we were not living together
that if i want to he would rent an apartment in dallas tomorrow that he didn't want me to remain with ruth any longer but wanted me to live with him in dallas
he repeated this not once but several times but i refused and he said that once again i was preferring my friends to him and that i didn't need him
question what did you say to that
answer i said it would be better if i remained with ruth until the holidays he would come and we would all meet together
that this was better because while he was living alone and i stayed with ruth we were spending less money and i told him to buy me a washing machine because two children
it became too difficult to wash by hand
what did he say to that
answer he said he would buy me a washing machine
question what did you say to that answer
thank you that it would be better if he bought something for himself that i would manage end quote that night oswald went to bed before his wife retired
she did not speak to him when she joined him there although she thought that he was still awake
the next morning he left for work before anyone else arose
for the first time
he left his wedding ring in a cup on the dresser in his room he also left one hundred seventy dollars in a wallet in one of the dresser drawers
he took with him thirteen dollars eighty seven cents and the long brown package that frazier and misess randle saw him carry
and which he was to take to the school book depository the unanswered questions
no one will ever know what passed through oswald's mind during the week before november twenty two nineteen sixty three
instead of returning to irving on november fifteen for his customary weekend visit he remained in dallas at his wife's suggestion because of the birthday party
he had argued with her over the use of an alias and had not called her after that argument although he usually telephoned once or twice a day
then on thursday morning november twenty one
he asked frazier for a ride to irving that night stating falsely that he wanted to pick up some curtain rods to put in an apartment
he must have planned his attack at the very latest prior to thursday morning when he spoke to frazier
there is of course no way to determine the degree to which he was committed to his plan at that time
while there is no way to tell when he first began to think specifically of assassinating the president
it should be noted that mention of the trade mart as the expected site of the presidential luncheon
appeared in the dallas times herald on november fifteen nineteen sixty three
the next day that paper announced the final approval of the trade mart as the luncheon site and stated that the motorcade quote
apparently will loop through the downtown area probably on main street
en route from dallas love field end quote on its way to the trade mart on stemmons freeway
anyone who was familiar with that area of dallas would have known that the motorcade would probably pass the texas school book depository to get from main street
onto the stemmons freeway
that fact was made precisely clear in subsequent news stories on november nineteen twenty and twenty two
on november fifteen nineteen sixty three the same day that his wife told him not to come to irving oswald could have assumed
that the presidential motorcade would pass in front of his place of work
whether he thought about assassinating the president over the weekend can never be known but it is reasonably certain
that over the weekend he did think about his wife's request that he not come to irving which was prompted by the birthday party being held at the paine home
oswald had a highly exaggerated sense of his own importance but he had failed at almost everything he had ever tried to do
he had great difficulty in establishing meaningful relations with other people except for his family he was completely alone
even though he had searched in the marine corps in his ideal of communism in the soviet union and in his attempt to get to cuba
he had never found anything to which he felt he could really belong
after he returned from his trip to mexico where his application to go to cuba had been sharply rejected
it must have appeared to him that he was unable to command even the attention of his family
he could not keep them with him in dallas where at least he could see his children whom several witnesses testified he seemed to love
his family lived with misess paine ostensibly because oswald could not afford to keep an apartment in dallas
but it was also at least in part because his wife did not want to live there with him
now it appeared that he was not welcome at the paine home
where he had spent every previous weekend since his return from mexico and his wife was once again calling into question his judgment
this time concerning his use of an alias
the conversation on monday november eighteen nineteen sixty three
ended when marina oswald hung up and refused to talk to him although he may long before have decided on the course he was to follow
and may have told his wife the things he did on the evening of november twenty one
nineteen sixty three merely to disarm her and to provide a justification of sorts
both she and misess paine thought he had come home to make up after the fight on monday
thoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least partly on his mind when he went to irving on thursday night and told his wife that he was lonely
that he wanted to make peace with her and bring his family to dallas where they could live with him again
the commission does not believe that the relations between oswald and his wife caused him to assassinate the president
it is unlikely that the motivation was that simple
the feelings of hostility and aggression which seem to have played such an important part in oswald's life
were part of his character long before he met his wife
and such a favorable opportunity to strike at a figure as great as the president would probably never have come to him again
oswald's behavior after the assassination throws little light on his motives
the fact that he took so little money with him when he left irving in the morning indicates that he did not expect to get very far from dallas on his own
and suggests the possibility as did his note to his wife just prior to the attempt on general walker that he did not expect to escape at all
on the other hand he could have traveled some distance with the money he did have and he did return to his room where he obtained his revolver
he then killed patrolman tippit when that police officer apparently tried to question him after he had left his roominghouse and he vigorously resisted arrest
when he was finally apprehended in the texas theatre although it is not fully corroborated by others who were present
two officers have testified that at the time of his arrest oswald said something to the effect that quote it's all over now end quote
oswald was overbearing and arrogant throughout much of the time between his arrest and his own death
he consistently refused to admit involvement in the assassination or in the killing of patrolman tippit
while he did become enraged at at least one point in his interrogation
the testimony of the officers present indicates that he handled himself with considerable composure during his questioning
he admitted nothing that would damage him but discussed other matters quite freely
his denials under questioning which have no probative value in view of the many readily demonstrable lies he told at that time
and in the face of the overwhelming evidence against him
which has been set forth above only served to prolong the period during which he was the center of the attention of the entire world
